Footnotes:

[^overlap]: By "non-overlapping" I mean that I have tried to resist featuring the same piece of content in two different classes. While some of the subject-matter will overlap between classes, "non-overlapping" guarentees that no matter how many of our courses you take, you'll never have to read the same book or listen to the same lecture twice.
