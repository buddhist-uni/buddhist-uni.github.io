## Part 1: From Craving to Liberation

With that background we're now ready to dive into the meat of the course: the textbooks themselves.

If you haven't already, now is a good time to read the Introduction to _[Hecker]({% link _content/monographs/similes-of-the-buddha_hecker.md %})_ as well as Analayo’s _[From Craving]({% link _content/monographs/craving-to-liberation_analayo.md %})_ as they set up the works we'll be looking at for the remainder of the class.

We will follow Bhikkhu Analayo’s _Excursions_ in order, but alongside reading each chapter, read a few suttas and some essays from _Hecker_.

As you go through the course, it might be a good idea to [keep a notebook of the suttas that speak to you](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/personal-sutta-anthology/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"}: a personal “medicine cabinet” of the Buddha's words that you can return to for inspiration and guidance whenever you need it. It's a good idea (if it helps you) to take notes on your own reflections, connections and ideas as you learn, but if you do I encourage you to keep those notes separate from your “anthology.”

## _Taṇhā_ — Craving

Chapter one of _From Craving to Liberation_ is about, well, craving. Bhikkhu Analayo's essay explores this term in depth. It can be read either before the suttas (as a primer) or after them (as an explainer).

### Suttas

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="sn27.8" %}
- What are the different types of craving?
{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="mn9.17" %}
- In defining Right View, the Four Noble Truths and "Craving" are central.
{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="an6.61" %}
- Who is the "seamstress" of _Saṃsāra_?
{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="snp4.1" %}
- A poem on our addiction to things of the world.

### Similes

Next, read the introduction to Part 2 (not part 1) of Hecker, along with similes **16 (The Wheel of Existence)** and **57 (Sensual Desire)**.

### Reflections

Having read the above, I noticed that craving figures prominantly in Buddhism's central images: the wheel, the boat, the arrow… I also noticed that these images all have the feeling of laborious, man-made objects. I guess that the Buddha is encouraging us to look at craving and to see it as something tedious and artificial, which we have both the power and desire to stop.

What did you notice?
