## An Introduction to the Buddha's Pyrotechnics

The fire of passion being “extinguished” gives us the term “*Nibbāna (nirvāna)*” and the "fire" of *samādhi* (meditation) is an enduring image in Buddhist text and art.  As we roll back in time to the Buddha's India, let us gaze a little closer into the flames:

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="fire-miracles_analayo" %}
- Bhikkhu Analayo explains some of the stories of the Buddha's miracles, and how a close reading of the texts can reveal the evolution of the legend.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="myth-as-meditation_gethin" %}
- Traditional Buddhists, however, read their myths less as history than as guides to the spiritual journey.

- Finally, rewinding the clock all the way back to the Buddha's own day, we learn how the Buddha played with ancient Vedic fire imagery to create his own creation myth.

### Optional Reading

- Ajahn Geoff explores the symbolism of extinguishment in the context of ancient Indian physics to give us another take on this central image of Buddhist soteriology.
