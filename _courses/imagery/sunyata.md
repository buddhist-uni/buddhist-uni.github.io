### Similes

This being the last section of our course, we will read the three remaining similes from [_Hecker_]({% link _content/monographs/similes-of-the-buddha_hecker.md %}) we haven't covered yet: **4**, **30**, and **73**. Congratulations! You've now finished the entire book!

### Reflection

It’s interesting to me that Bhikkhu Anālayo placed “emptiness” last. It seems to borrow from later Mahayana thoughts on the “two truths” and “perfection of wisdom,” since emptiness in the EBTs seems more closely related to _vipassana_ than _vimutti_. What do you think? Is emptiness the end of the path, or merely instrumental? How does understanding the EBTs as rhetoric help you to answer this question?
