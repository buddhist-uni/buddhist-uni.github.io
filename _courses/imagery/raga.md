### Similes

Read the introduction to Part 1 of [Hecker]({% link _content/monographs/similes-of-the-buddha_hecker.md %}) now, and the similes: **7**, **14**, **39** and **44**.

_(Don't forget to read Analayo Chapter 2!)_

### Reflections

I notice that the passion images (a stream, an ocean, an affliction) are more wet and natural than the images for its near-synonym “craving” (though of course still negative). What does this say about the Buddhist attitude towards passion (especially vis-a-vis craving)? How are they different?
