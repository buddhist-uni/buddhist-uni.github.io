## What is Buddhism as a Religion?
Whether Buddhism even is a “religion” at all is, of course, a matter of some controversy. Is it a philosophy? A movement? A practice? An aesthetic? Who even counts as “a Buddhist”?

In defining the bounds of “who is Buddhist”, some “middle way” may be desirable, between:
1. The conservative, “prescriptive” definition (The Buddha [once said](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN55_40.html) that only beings on their way to enlightenment count as his followers!)
2. And the completely liberal, “historical” definition (The Buddha's life has materially impacted everything from ancient trade routes, to Islamic art, Christian conflicts, IKEA designs, software engineering practices… nearly every human life today.)

In searching for such a middle way, I take on Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of 'religion' here, and say that “Religion is whatever you take seriously.” 

The religious forms of Buddhism, then, are the various ways that people have looked back to the Buddha for guidance and inspiration, and the many ways they have found to reshape their lives in response to what they've seen.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes familiarity with [the fundamentals of Buddhism](/courses/buddhism).

## The Course
This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. 

The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism; the second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community; and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices.

### Introduction
On forms and the formless.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="on-science-religion-and-culture_yuttadhammo" %}
- Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism.


{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="what-buddhism-offers_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism.

### Sourcebook

Throughout this course, we'll be using a **Common Buddhist Text** as our primary source:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="common-buddhist-text" %}
- An anthology from the canons of the Three Vehicles, giving us a taste of the canonical literature from the various traditions.

Selections will be referenced like this:

- [CBT] L.59
  - For example, this refers to the passage in *Common Buddhist Text* about Ven Vaṅgīsa which contains a poem in praise of the Buddha. 
  - Go ahead and look up that passage now. Search the PDF or skim the Table of Contents for the given reference number ("L.59", in this case).
  - This passage is on page 84 of the above-linked pdf, for example, but the pages differ in different editions, so I'll stick to the reference numbers for the rest of this course.


### Part 1: The History of Buddhism
#### Textbook

The main textbook for this first third of the course will be:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="buddhist-religion_robinson-et-al" %}
- *Robinson* gives an accessible and enjoyable survey of Buddhism’s long history across Asia and beyond.

#### Supplementary Material to *Robinson*

As you read through Robinson et al's _Historical Introduction_ one chapter at a time, please also consider:

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 1: The Buddha's Awakening

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="buddha-you-never-knew_dhammika" %}
- The Buddha was a real, historical figure, but many of the stories about his life are myths still expanding today.

[CBT] L.7–17 (L.7 through L.17)
{:.mb-0}
- Here we get the Buddha's spiritual journey in his own words.
- Notice the repetitive nature of the early, oral texts.

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 2: The Buddha as Teacher

[CBT] Th.13, L.25, Th.205, L.23, L.30, L.34, L.39, L.42, L.53, L.57, Th.28, Th.59, Th.73–75, Th.98, Th.171
{:.mb-0}
- Here we get a few stories about the Buddha's life as a teacher from the early texts.
- The Buddha's life and teachings are, of course, the cornerstone of the Buddhist religion, and set its tenor.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="stupas-of-shwedagon_u-win-maung" %}
- “Stupas” are mentioned as sites of worship even in the earliest texts and archaeology as the burial sites of great leaders. This paper shows what those looked like, from ancient India to modern Burma.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="symbolism-of-the-early-stupa_harvey" %}
- They're beautiful, aren't they? This article talks about some of the symbolism the form came to represent.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-wheel-symbol_karunaratne" %}
- While the Christians have the <i class="fas fa-cross"></i> cross and the Jews the <i class="fas fa-star-of-david"></i> star, the Buddhists have the <i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> wheel as the symbol of their religion. But where did this wheel come from and what does it mean?

##### Parallel to Robinson chapter 3: “Development”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="assertion-and-restraint_dixon-graham" %}
- Buddhism is not an especially evangelical religion. This paper explores the unique (compared to other religions) way that Buddhism spread.

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="venerated-objects-early-buddhism_harvey" %}
- The early Buddhists of ancient India did not represent the Buddha with anthropomorphic statues as is ubiquitous now. This essay explores the symbols and objects that were venerated in the early period after the Buddha’s death.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="lotus-as-symbol_olson_carl" %}
- One such object which became notably ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures is the lotus flower.  This article explores the ancient origins and meaning of this potent symbol.

[CBT] M.5, Th.94
{:.mb-0}
- Buddhists lament the passing of their teacher and build monuments in his memory.

[CBT] Th.157
{:.mb-0}
- This verse was especially popular to carve on early monuments to the Buddha.

[CBT] Th.217
{:.mb-0}
- An account of the first council of the Buddha's disciples after his death, at which the teachings were first codified.

[CBT] M.96
{:.mb-0}
- On the practice of releasing animals for merit, a tradition now found across the Buddhist world.

##### Chapter 4: “The Rise of Mahayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="second-buddha_loy" %}
- Nagarjuna criticized the excessive developments of Buddhism in the centuries after the Buddha and reestablished emptiness as the central tenet of Buddhism, laying the philosophical groundwork for the Mahayana.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="arahants-bodhisattvas-and-buddhas_bodhi" %}
- In this essay, Bhikkhu Bodhi explores the Bodhisattva ideal from the perspective of the Theravāda and Mahayana.

[CBT] Th.210
{:.mb-0}
- The description of reality as perceived by an awakened being in the early texts became the basis for much speculation about the nature of reality after the Buddha's passing

[CBT] M.143, M.16, M.111–112 (note: M.112 is mislabeled "M.114")
{:.mb-0}
- Nirvana came to be identified as being the same as ultimate reality, and as the essential nature of the mind.

[CBT] M.44, M.61, M.103, M.137
{:.mb-0}
- "Emptiness"—also present in early Buddhism—was deployed to counter this essentializing tendency.

[CBT] M.62, M.142
{:.mb-0}
- This eventually led to a "Middle Way" synthesis of these philosophical extremes.

##### Chapter 5: “The Pantheon”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="karma-vibanga-reliefs-at-borobudur_anandajoti" %}
- In the centuries after the Buddha, many of the subtleties of karma were simplified for didactic expediency. This led to a formulaic, "if you do this, this will happen to you" understanding of karma (which the Buddha himself rejected as fatalistic) that came to be repeated in later texts (such as the Karma-Vibanga) and in Buddhist art (such as, here, at Borobudur) for millennia, perpetuating a (mis)understanding of Karma which persists today.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="abduction-of-queen-kakati_patrick-kit" %}
- But, as Buddhism became more popular and spread around and out of India, it also picked up an artistic and mythological richness that textured and enlivened the tradition. Indeed, Buddhism’s ability to embrace and contextualize local mythology has long been a key to its ability to spread peacefully.
- The story behind [this ancient, Buddhist statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gandhara,_garuda_adduce_la_regina_kakati,_periodo_kushan_200-400.JPG){:target="_blank"}.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="narratives-of-buddhist-relics-and-images_berkwitz-s" %}
- Such foreign converts often yearned for a solid connection back to the Buddha. One common expression of this was the creation and authentication of local "souvenirs" which also play a prominent role in popular Buddhism to this day.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="true-dhamma-has-disappeared_geoff" %}
- In addition to new relics and stories explaining them, many new teachings were also introduced. Today, as all the remaining traditions have picked up their fair share of shady teachers, deity cults, and doctrinal confusion, Ajahn Geoff reminds us that we have to be discerning about where we place our faith.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="pure-land_bloom" %}
- All these factors—increased deification, a concern over death and the decline of the sasana, etc—fueled the movement towards what we now call "Pure Land" Buddhism: a next-life focused practice still very popular in East Asia today.

[CBT] V.33, M.56–57, M.49, M.91, M.67, M.99
{:.mb-0}
- Practitioners came to be encouraged to aspire to Buddhahood themselves and to take the Bodhisattva Path rather than to take the "lesser" path of the disciple so as to maximize the benefit that their enlightenment can have for others.

[CBT] M.68
{:.mb-0}
- Role models, guides, and supporters are crucial for this Bodhisattva Path.

[CBT] M.55
{:.mb-0}
- Thankfully, there are advanced Bodhisattvas living now as gods who can be called upon to support you on your journey.

[CBT] M.144, M.6
{:.mb-0}
- Even the Buddha himself came to be immortalized as a quasi-god.

[CBT] M.107, M.154
{:.mb-0}
- If the Buddha isn't truly gone, then that means all the Buddhas of the past are also still out there, making them nearly indistinguishable from the advanced, heavenly Bodhisattvas.

[CBT] M.158
{:.mb-0}
- We can even aspire to be reborn in one of those "Buddha fields" where a Buddha is currently teaching, which promises a fast track to enlightenment.

[CBT] M.129
{:.mb-0}
- This all eventually came to mirror Hinduism so closely that this sutra directly equates the Buddha with Brahma and the Buddhists with the Brahmins. 

##### After Chapter 6 of Robinson on “Vajrayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="mudras_tricycle" %}
- Taking an important role during the later development of Buddhist art and esoterica, mudras such as the “Anjali” of respect are now ubiquitous in the Buddhist cultural sphere, and are nearly synonymous with Buddhism itself.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="central-asian_kudara" %}
- While largely not Buddhist today, the deserts of Central Asia were key to the medieval spread of Buddhism.

{% include content_blurb.html category="reference" slug="electronic-atlas-of-monasteries_ciolek" blurb="Take a second to appreciate the explosive spread of Buddhism across Asia shown in these maps of medieval monasteries." %}

[CBT] Th.208

- A brief overview of the Theravāda "Wat" (monastery) and its relationship with the lay community.

[CBT] Th.31
{:.mb-0}

{:.mb-0}
- The Theravāda is also famous for its "morbid" meditations on pain and death.

[CBT] Th.52, Th.108
{:.mb-0}
- But Theravāda isn't all bleak, as they also celebrate the beauty of the Dhamma and of good companionship.

[CBT] Th.218, M.14
{:.mb-0}
- Notice here how sutras and scholarship themselves came to be objects of worship.

[CBT] M.165
{:.mb-0}

[CBT] M.80
{:.mb-0}
- They advocated a wise, flexible ethics not slavishly devoted to following monastic rules.

[CBT] M.127
{:.mb-0}
- And a "direct, non-conceptual" experience of the truth, opposed to the mere "verbal" Dharma of the sutras.

[CBT] M.31
{:.mb-0}
- Both these traditions (the scholarly and Chan) went through periods of patronage and persecution, which left a lasting lesson on the impermanence of fame immortalized in poetry such as this.

[CBT] M.167
{:.mb-0}
- We end our section on China by reading this very famous story about the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School.

##### Robinson Chapter 9: Korea and Vietnam

[CBT] M.27, M.102

{:.mb-0}
- And here we read about the vast array of Buddha fields across the ocean-like multiverse and how to attain rebirth in one.
