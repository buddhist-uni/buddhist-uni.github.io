## What is the Form of Buddhism?
The Form of Buddhism is the “religious” side of Buddhism: the history, institutions, rituals and externalities that socially define the religion.

Whether Buddhism even is a “religion” at all is, of course, a matter of some controversy. Is it a philosophy? A movement? A practice? An aesthetic? Who even counts as “a Buddhist”?

In defining the bounds of “who is Buddhist”, some “middle way” may be desirable, between:
1. The conservative, “prescriptive” definition (The Buddha once said that only enlightened beings count as his followers!)
2. And the completely liberal, “historical” definition (The Buddha's life has materially impacted everything from ancient trade routes, to Islamic art, Christian conflicts, IKEA designs, software engineering practices… nearly every human life today.)

In searching for such a middle way, I take on Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of Religion here, and say that “Religion is whatever you take seriously.” 

The forms of Buddhism, then, are the various ways that people have looked back to the Buddha for guidance and inspiration, and the many ways they have found to reshape their lives in response to what they've seen.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with [the fundamentals of Buddhism]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}), but no worries if you're rusty: you'll get a refresher [below](#i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron).


## Course Outline
This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. 

The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism. The second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community, and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices.

### Introduction
On forms and the formless.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="on-science-religion-and-culture_yuttadhammo" %}
- Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism.


{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="what-buddhism-offers_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism.

### Sourcebook

Throughout this course, we'll be using a **Common Buddhist Text** as our primary source:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="common-buddhist-text" %}
- An anthology from the canons of the Three Vehicles, giving us a taste of the canonical literature from the various traditions.

Selections will be referenced like this:

- [CBT] L.59
  - For example, this refers to the passage in *Common Buddhist Text* about Ven Vaṅgīsa which contains a poem in praise of the Buddha. 
  - To look up the passage, search the PDF or skim the Table of Contents for the reference number ("L.59").

This passage, for example, is on page 84 of the above pdf (note: page numbers differ in the printed editions).


### Part 1: The Sociology and History of Buddhism
#### Textbooks

There are two textbooks for this first part of the course:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="buddhist-religion_robinson-et-al" %}
- The main textbook for this part, *Robinson* will give us an accessible and enjoyable survey of Buddhism’s long history across Asia and beyond.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-sociological-thought_gnanarama" %}
- A more theoretical text, *Gnanarama* will provide an introduction to how Buddhists  themselves thought about the sociology of religion.
- Feel free to skip the readings from this book if you're not as interested in theory.


#### Introduction

Let us start off by reading Chapter 1 (“Towards a Definition”) of _Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought_ to round off our discussion of how Buddhism can be defined as a “religion” and how it may relate to other concepts you've heard of.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron" %}
- For a refresher on the basics of Buddhism, I recommend skimming this Q&A with Thubten Chodron before we dive into the more detailed history below.
- There's no need to read it thoroughly: just read the answers to whatever questions interest you.

#### Supplementary Material to *Robinson*

As you read through Robinson et al's _Historical Introduction_ one chapter at a time, please also consider:

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 1: Awakening

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="buddha-you-never-knew_dhammika" %}
- The Buddha was a real, historical figure, but many of the stories about his life are myths still expanding today.

[CBT] L.7–17
- Here we get the Buddha's spiritual journey in his own words.
- Notice the repetitive nature of the early, oral texts.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 2: Dhamma, Medicine and Sociology
{:.mb-0}
- This chapter introduces us to the central metaphor of Buddhism as a medical science, and the social implications of that framing.

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 2: Teacher

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_history_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- An Introduction to Buddhist History

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="stupas-of-shwedagon_u-win-maung" %}
- “Stupas” are mentioned as sites of worship even in the earliest texts and archeology as the burial sites of great leaders. This paper shows what those looked like, from ancient India to modern Burma.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="symbolism-of-the-early-stupa_harvey" %}
- They're beautiful, aren't they? But what do they mean?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-wheel-symbol_karunaratne" %}
- While the Christians have the <i class="fas fa-cross"></i> cross and the Jews the <i class="fas fa-star-of-david"></i> star, the Buddhists have the <i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> wheel as the symbol of their religion. But where did this wheel come from and what does it mean?

[CBT] Th.13, L.25, Th.205, L.23, L.30, L.34, L.39, L.42, L.53, L.57, Th.28, Th.59, Th.73–75, Th.98, Th.116, Th.171
- Here we get a few stories about the Buddha's life as a teacher from the early texts.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 3: Significance of Buddhist Chanting
{:.mb-0}
- Even in the Buddha’s time, monks would recite the teachings verbatim to acclimate to them and keep them in mind. Over time, this chanting became seen as apotropaic and was therefore ritualized quite early on. Today, chanting features prominently across Buddhist traditions and practices.

##### Parallel to Robinson chapter 3: “Development”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="assertion-and-restraint_dixon-graham" %}
- Buddhism is not an especially evangelical religion. This paper explores the unique (compared to other religions) way that Buddhism spread.

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="venerated-objects-early-buddhism_harvey" %}
- The early Buddhists of ancient India did not represent the Buddha with anthropomorphic statues as is ubiquitous now. This essay explores the symbols and objects that were venerated in the early period after the Buddha’s death.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="lotus-as-symbol_olson_carl" %}
- One such object which became notably ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures is the lotus flower.  This article explores the ancient origins and meaning of this potent symbol.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="offering-flowers_dodrupchen" %}
- And this essay commends the virtues of offering flowers: a lovely practice still common across Buddhist Asia

[CBT] M.5, Th.94
- Buddhists lament the passing of their teacher and build monuments in his memory.
[CBT] Th.157
- This verse was especially popular to carve on early monuments to the Buddha.
[CBT] Th.217
- An account of the first council of the Buddha's disciples after his death, at which the teachings were first codified.
[CBT] M.14
- In praise of the Sutras, preserved after the Buddha's death.
[CBT] M.36, M.38
- On the practice of giving to the Sangha in order to transfer merit to one’s deceased relatives: a practice that became common in the years after the Buddha.
[CBT] M.96
- On the practice of releasing animals for merit, a tradition now found across the Buddhist world.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 5 (we'll come back to 4 later): Buddhist Art Symbols For Religious Edification
{:.mb-0}
- Art, offerings and other public devotions provided early (and current)  Buddhists with an effective, yet soft, way to spread the religion.

##### Chapter 4: “The Rise of Mahayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="arahants-bodhisattvas-and-buddhas_bodhi" %}
- In this essay, Bhikkhu Bodhi explores the Bodhisattva ideal from the perspective of the Theravada and Mahayana.

[CBT] Th.210
- The description of reality as perceived by an awakened being in the early texts became the basis for much speculation about the nature of reality after the Buddha's passing
[CBT] M.143, M.16, M.111–112 (note: M.112 is mislabeled "M.114")
- Nirvana came to be identified as being the same as ultimate reality, and as the essential nature of the mind.
[CBT] M.44, M.61, M.103, M.137
- "Emptiness"—also present in early Buddhism—was deployed to counter this essentializing tendency.
[CBT] M.62, M.142
- This eventually led to a "Middle Way" synthesis of these philosophical extremes.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 4 (as promised): Aesthetics
{:.mb-0}
- Aesthetics was actually a major point of departure for the Early Mahayana, who rejected the cold austerity of the Abhidhamma in favor of more beautiful expressions of enlightened wisdom.

##### Chapter 5: “The Pantheon”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="karma-vibanga-reliefs-at-borobudur_anandajoti" %}
- In the centuries after the Buddha, many of the subtleties of karma were simplified for didactic expedience. This led to a formulaic, "if you do this, this will happen to you" understanding of karma (which the Buddha himself rejected as fatalistic) that came to be repeated ad-infinitum in texts (such as the Karma-Vibanga) and in Buddhist art (such as, here, at Borobudur) for millennia, perpetuating a (mis)understanding of Karma which has persisted to today.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="abduction-of-queen-kakati_patrick-kit" %}
- But, as Buddhism became more popular and spread around and out of India, it also picked up an artistic and mythological richness that textured and enlivened the tradition. Indeed, Buddhism’s ability to embrace and contextualize local mythology has long been a key to its ability to spread peacefully.
- The story behind [this ancient, Buddhist statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gandhara,_garuda_adduce_la_regina_kakati,_periodo_kushan_200-400.JPG){:target="_blank"}.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="narratives-of-buddhist-relics-and-images_berkwitz-s" %}
- Such foreign converts often yearned for a solid connection back to the Buddha. One common expression of this was the creation and authentication of local "souvenirs" which also play a prominent role in popular Buddhism to this day.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="true-dhamma-has-disappeared_geoff" %}
- In addition to new relics and stories explaining them, many new teachings were also introduced. Today, as all the remaining traditions have picked up their fair share of shady teachers, deity cults, and doctrinal confusion, Ajahn Geoff reminds us that we have to be discerning about where we place our faith.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 6: Socialization for Death
{:.mb-0}
- What effect does Buddhism's encouragement to reflect on death and impermanence have on how Buddhists perceive the cosmos, life, and the religion itself?

[CBT] M.73, V.33, M.56–57, M.49, M.91, M.67, M.99
- Practitioners came to be encouraged to aspire to Buddhahood themselves and to take the Bodhisattva Path rather than to take the "lesser" path of the disciple so as to maximize the benefit that their enlightenment can have for others.
[CBT] M.68
- Role models, guides, and supporters are crucial for this Bodhisattva Path.
[CBT] M.55
- Thankfully, there are advanced Bodhisattvas living now as gods who can be called upon to support you on your journey.
[CBT] M.144, M.6
- Even the Buddha himself came to be immortalized as a quasi-god.
[CBT] M.107, M.154
- If the Buddha isn't truly gone, then that means all the Buddhas of the past are also still out there, making them nearly indistinguishable from the advanced, heavenly Bodhisattvas.
[CBT] M.158
- We can even aspire to be reborn in one of those "Buddha fields" where a Buddha is currently teaching, which promises a fast track to enlightenment.
[CBT] M.129
- This all eventually came to mirror Hinduism so closely that this sutra directly equates the Buddha with Brahma and the Buddhists with the Brahmins. 

##### After Chapter 6 of Robinson on “Vajrayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="mudras_tricycle" %}
- Taking an important role during the later development of Buddhist art and esoterica, mudras such as the “Anjali” of respect are now ubiquitous in the Buddhist cultural sphere, and are nearly synonymous with Buddhism itself.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="story-of-the-horse-king_appleton" %}
- One story, five countries.
- Shows how each nation where Buddhism spread adapted the Indic mythology to explain their own local conditions, and gives us a fascinating window into the spread of Buddhism across Asia.

[CBT] Th.208
- The early textual basis for equating enlightenment with a "diamond-like" mind.
[CBT] M.11, M.17, V.3, M.22, M.42, V.23, V.30, V.38, V.43, M.106, M.114, M.147–149
- A few selections from the Vajrayana Canon showing its last developments in India. 

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 7: Social Conflict
- A short essay on the Buddhist understanding of conflict
- See also, [CBT] Th.17–20

##### Parallel to Robinson's Regional Chapters 

As we transition to more contemporary forms of Buddhism, let us set aside *Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought* for now, and take a brief listen to two Buddhists (one Sri Lankan and the other Chinese) chanting themselves to bed. Though not typical of their traditions' evening services, these two rare recordings capture, for me, something of their beauty.

##### Robinson Chapter 7: Sri Lanka

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bojjhanga-suttas_dhammaruwan" %}
- First, we have this extraordinary recording of a boy in Sri Lanka spontaneously remembering how he chanted Pāli in a past life.

[CBT] Th.31
- The ideal of the "Righteous Monarch" was hugely influential in the Theravada world and continues to justify monarchy in Thailand today.
[CBT] Th.215
- The Theravada monks, meanwhile, hold up Sariputta as their ideal: the wise, analytical follower of the Buddha.
[CBT] Th.90–91, Th.146, Th.159
- The Theravadin philosophical tradition loves to break Dharmas into exact parts and definitions.
[CBT] Th.135, Th.152, Th.145
- The Theravada is also famous for its "morbid" meditations on pain and death.
[CBT] Th.52, Th.108
- But Theravada isn't all bleak, as they also celebrate the beauty of the Dhamma and of good companionship.
[CBT] Th.194
- Very conservative in their practice of the monastic rules, Theravada monks still go on alms round and abstain from eating dinner to this day.
[CBT] Th.117, Th.172, Th.181, Th.196, Th.226
- Lastly, we read Theravada responses to some Mahayana ideas.


##### Robinson Chapter 8: China

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="drums-and-bells_qing-de" %}
- A monk at a lonely temple, deep in the mountains of Taiwan, says goodbye to the day with drum and bell.

[CBT] Th.41, M.115
- The Confucian social values of ancient China found a natural counterpart in certain early Buddhist teachings, which came to be emphasized.
[CBT] Th.50, M.34
- Here, for example, we compare the earlier (Theravada) perspective on honoring one's parents with the Chinese perspective.
[CBT] M85–86
- Yet there were some real innovations, such as the Chinese Buddhist embrace of vegetarianism.
[CBT] Th.218, M.14
- Notice here how sutras and scholarship themselves came to be objects of worship.
[CBT] M.165
- The Chan/Zen school, however, rejected this new focus on texts, and claimed an authority based on a transmission "outside" the Sutras.
[CBT] M.80
- They advocated a wise, flexible ethics not slavishly devoted to following monastic rules.
[CBT] M.127
- And a "direct, non-conceptual" experience of the truth,opposed to the mere "verbal" Dharma of the sutras.
[CBT] M.31
- Both these traditions (the scholarly and Chan) went through periods of patronage and persecution, which left a lasting lesson on the impermanence of fame immortalized in poetry such as this.
[CBT] M.167
- We end our section on China by reading this very famous story about the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School.

##### Robinson Chapter 9: Korea and Vietnam

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="faxians-account-of-anuradhapura_kim-haewon" %}
- What does a Chinese monk's pilgrimage to Sri Lanka have to do with Korea?

[CBT] M.18, M.26, M.78, M.108, M.118, M.149
- The Vietnamese and Korean traditions have taken on a more "engaged" attitude towards Awakening and the Bodhisattva path.

##### Robinson Chapter 10: Japan

{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="introduction-to-buddhist-art_smith-doug" %}

[CBT] M.27, M.102
- Japanese Buddhists are famous for their patient austerity.
[CBT] M.81
- Yet they often have a rather lenient attitude towards e.g. alcohol.
[CBT] M.105, M.159
- A Bodhisattva can make vows to delay their awakening in order to construct an elaborate and appealing "Buddha field" into which their followers may be reborn. Here we read the vows of the Buddha Amitabha, whose worship is especially popular in Japanese Buddhism.
[CBT] M.39, M.74
- And here we read about the vast array of Buddha fields across the ocean-like multiverse and how to attain rebirth in one.
[CBT] M.156
- On the other hand, all such notions (even up to enlightenment itself) are in fact empty, and there is actually nothing to attain.

##### Robinson Chapter 11: Tibet

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="reexamination-of-female-inferiority_goodwin-allison" %}
- Now that we've covered all the "traditional" forms of Buddhism, we can take a closer look at one particular element of cultural Buddhism that has been surprisingly ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures: misogyny.
- Allison Goodwin gives a brief outline of the discrimination faced by women in Buddhism, and a thoroughly cited argument for rejecting sexist views, even those that appear in the Buddhist Canon.

[CBT] V.47
- How to help others, including the place for supernormal powers.
[CBT] V.22
- The Dharma is not an impermanent thing.
[CBT] V.70
- A passage from the "Tibetan Book of the Dead" on the nature of mind.
[CBT] V.71–73
- On the three kinds of knowledge. Philosophy in general, and epistemology in particular, is highly valued in Tibetan Buddhism.
[CBT] V.78
- Ultimate knowledge is, however, non-dual.
[CBT] M.168, V.80
- Tibetan Buddhism is (in)famous for its worldly teachers. These passages describe one such role model for the engaged Bodhisattva.
[CBT] V.91
- Exuberant guru and deity worship are also notable features of Tibetan Buddhism.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 8: Women's Social Role
{:.mb-0}
- We (finally) return to *Aspects*' final chapter for a look at how the Buddha originally taught women.

##### Robinson Chapter 12: “Buddhism Comes West”

[CBT] Th.23, Th.25, Th.26, Th.47, Th.104, Th.118, Th.129, Th.155, Th.203, Th.207
- Western, "Protestant" Buddhists have selected certain strands from the early Canon to emphasize. Here, we read some of their favorite passages.

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="altruism-in-classical-buddhism_lewis-todd" %}
- A brief look back at Altruism, and one tiny example of Western Philosophy grappling with Buddhism. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bridging-the-two-vehicles_bodhi" %}
- As the Dhamma comes West, and globalization connects us all, we have a unique opportunity now to bridge the gaps that history and geography created... but only if we choose to do so.

And with that, we're now finished with Part 1 of our course! **History is now yours to make!**
{:.mt-4}

### Part 2: The Sangha

Zooming in slightly from the historical perspective, we next turn our attention to the dynamics of individual Buddhist communities.

#### Introduction

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="end-of-the-buddhist-utopia_sujato" %}
- Bhante Sujato starts by asking why Buddhism died out in India, and what factors will lead to the end of our own (present day) "Buddhist Utopia"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn45.2" %}
- Joseph Goldstein reads the Buddha's own take on “the entire spiritual life.”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="going-forth_viradhammo" %}
- A beautiful sermon on the value of monasticism.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="making-buddha-statues-cultivation_drba" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="we-love-our-nuns_mrozik" %}
- A paper on how the flourishing of the monastic community affects everyone around them.

[CBT] Th.54, Th.85–88, Th.105,  
- Good friendship is vital on the path to Awakening.
[CBT] Th.79
- The Sangha are not priests. Buddhist monks cannot purify you, only you can purify you
[CBT] M.89, Th.95
- Still, you should receive the precepts from someone keeping them, and monks and nuns across the Buddhist world chant protective blessings for their lay supporters.
[CBT] Th.190
- The lay and monastic communities are vital to the support of each other.

#### Main Text

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="culture-of-awakening_cintita" %}

[CBT] Th.191, Th.204
- The core of the Sangha is the Ariya Sangha: those disciples who have attained awakening themselves. As long as they are present, and the community meets in harmony, the Dharma will thrive.

#### Coda

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="monasticism-and-western-adaption_karma-lekshe-tsomo" %}
- Buddhist monasticism faces many challenges as it comes West, especially for nuns.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="healing-is-possible_tnh" %}
- An inspiring talk to a group of monastics, encouraging them to set a good example for their guests, showing how there need not be such a strict tension between personal practice and social engagement.

### Part 3: Personal Practice

The last third of our class tackles the more prescriptive, “micro” question of our own, individual practice: What should one do to be a Buddhist?

#### Textbook

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="lay-buddhist-practice_khantipalo" %}

[CBT] Th.39–40, Th.49, Th.96, Th.112, Th.114
- The Buddha’s description of (/prescription for) "the good life" for a householder.
[CBT] Th.228, M.162
- Citta the Householder shows what is possible for laypeople to achieve.

#### Supplements

We have two supplements for *Khantipalo*:

##### Taking Refuge

Listen to this alongside the section of Khantipalo about refuge and the triple gem:

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="becoming-buddhist_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo talks about what it means to be a Buddhist, and how to think about “taking refuge”

[CBT] Th.89, Th.93, M.82
- The path starts with faith.


##### Practicing Restraint

A few more words are also due on the subject of restraint, beyond the five precepts. Please consider this alongside the section on “practice”

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.239" %}
- Explains the three primary duties of a monk: guarding the senses, moderation in eating, and the devotion to wakefulness. 
- What monastic behaviors and vows do you know about already? How do the monastic and “eight precept” observances help with these three duties? What do you think is their benefit? Can lay Buddhists practice these? Should they?

[CBT] Th.21, Th.102, Th.122
- On wholesome and unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind.
[CBT] M.109, M.124
- On how to use meditation as an antidote to greed, hatred, and restlessness.
[CBT] V.55–56
- Does this admonishment to practice solitude contrast with the emphasis on the spiritual community we read earlier? How do you explain this tension?

#### Praxis Conclusion 

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="dhammavinaya_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo revisits [the Gotami Sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.053.than.html){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} (which you may remember from the [Intro to Buddhism Course]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %})) and tells us how we can recognize when our own practice of Buddhism goes off track.

[CBT] V.52, V.54
- No matter what happens: never give up.

### Conclusion to the Class

[CBT] Th.24
- The purpose of learning is to calm the mind.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="pseudobuddhism_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm, in his light-hearted way, comments on the above verse.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="dedication_longchenpa" %}
- It's common in many Buddhist cultures to end a meritorious event or auspicious occasion with a short dedication. Here is a typical such prayer from the Tibetan Tradition.
