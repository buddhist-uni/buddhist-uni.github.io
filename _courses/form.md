## What is the Form of Buddhism?
The Form of Buddhism is the “religious” side of Buddhism: the history, institutions, rituals and externalities that socially define the religion.

Whether Buddhism even is a “religion” at all is, of course, a matter of some controversy. Is it a philosophy? A movement? A practice? An aesthetic? Who even counts as “a Buddhist”?

In defining the bounds of “who is Buddhist”, some “middle way” may be desirable, between:
1. The conservative, “prescriptive” definition (The Buddha once said that only enlightened beings count as his followers!)
2. And the completely liberal, “historical” definition (The Buddha's life has materially impacted everything from ancient trade routes, to Islamic art, Christian conflicts, IKEA designs, software engineering practices… nearly every human life today.)

In searching for such a middle way, I take on Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of Religion here, and say that “Religion is whatever you take seriously.” 

The forms of Buddhism, then, are the various ways that people have looked back to the Buddha for guidance and inspiration, and the many ways they have found to reshape their lives in response to what they've seen.

## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with [the fundamentals of Buddhism]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}), but no worries if you're rusty: you'll get a refresher [below](#i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron).


## Course Outline
This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. 

The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism. The second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community, and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices.

### Introduction
On forms and the formless.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="on-science-religion-and-culture_yuttadhammo" %}
- Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism.


{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="what-buddhism-offers_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism.

### Part 1: The Sociology and History of Buddhism
#### Textbooks

There are two textbooks for this first part of the course:

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-sociological-thought_gnanarama" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="buddhist-religion_robinson-et-al" %}

#### Introduction

Let us start off by reading Chapter 1 (“Towards a Definition”) of _Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought_ to round off our discussion of how Buddhism can be defined as a “religion” and how it may relate to other concepts you've heard of.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron" %}
- For a refresher on the basics of Buddhism, I recommend skimming this Q&A with Thubten Chodron before we dive into the more detailed history below.

#### Supplementary Material to *Robinson*

As you read through Robinson et al's _Historical Introduction_ one chapter at a time, please also consider:

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 1: Awakening

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="buddha-you-never-knew_dhammika" %}
- The Buddha was a real, historical figure, but many of the stories about his life are myths still expanding today.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="noble-quest_horner" %}
- What do the ancient texts say about the Buddha?
- Here, the Buddha tells his own story, and encourages us to also seek the deathless.
- If the language of this translation is too archaic for you, no worries! It's included here just to give you a taste of the ancient texts. 

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 2: Dhamma, Medicine and Sociology
{:.mb-0}
- This chapter introduces us to the central metaphor of Buddhism as a medical science, and the social implications of that framing.

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 2: Teacher

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_history_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- An Introduction to Buddhist History

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="stupas-of-shwedagon_u-win-maung" %}
- “Stupas” are mentioned as sites of worship even in the earliest texts and archeology as the burial sites of great leaders. This paper shows what those looked like, from ancient India to modern Burma.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="symbolism-of-the-early-stupa_harvey" %}
- They're beautiful, aren't they? But what do they mean?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-wheel-symbol_karunaratne" %}
- While the Christians have the <i class="fas fa-cross"></i> cross and the Jews the <i class="fas fa-star-of-david"></i> star, the Buddhists have the <i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> wheel as the symbol of their religion. But where did this wheel come from and what does it mean?

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 3: Significance of Buddhist Chanting
{:.mb-0}
- Even in the Buddha’s time, monks would recite the teachings verbatim to acclimate to them and keep them in mind. Over time, this chanting became seen as apotropaic and was therefore ritualized quite early on. Today, chanting features prominently across Buddhist traditions and practices.

##### Parallel to Robinson chapter 3: “Development”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="assertion-and-restraint_dixon-graham" %}
- Buddhism is not an especially evangelical religion. This paper explores the unique (compared to other religions) way that Buddhism spread.

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="venerated-objects-early-buddhism_harvey" %}
- The early Buddhists of ancient India did not represent the Buddha with anthropomorphic statues as is ubiquitous now. This essay explores the symbols and objects that were venerated in the early period after the Buddha’s death.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="lotus-as-symbol_olson_carl" %}
- One such object which became notably ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures is the lotus flower.  This article explores the ancient origins and meaning of this potent symbol.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="offering-flowers_dodrupchen" %}
- And this essay commends the virtues of offering flowers: a lovely practice still common across Buddhist Asia

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 5 (we'll come back to 4 later): Buddhist Art Symbols For Religious Edification
{:.mb-0}
- Art, offerings and other public devotions provided early (and current)  Buddhists with an effective, yet soft, way to spread the religion.

##### Chapter 4: “The Rise of Mahayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="arahants-bodhisattvas-and-buddhas_bodhi" %}
- In this essay, Bhikkhu Bodhi explores the Bodhisattva ideal from the perspective of the Theravada and Mahayana.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 4 (as promised): Aesthetics
{:.mb-0}
- Aesthetics was actually a major point of departure for the Early Mahayana, who rejected the cold austerity of the Abhidhamma in favor of more beautiful expressions of enlightened wisdom.

##### Chapter 5: “The Pantheon”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="karma-vibanga-reliefs-at-borobudur_anandajoti" %}
- In the centuries after the Buddha, many of the subtleties of karma were simplified for didactic expedience. This led to a formulaic, "if you do this, this will happen to you" understanding of karma (which the Buddha himself rejected as fatalistic) that came to be repeated ad-infinitum in texts (such as the Karma-Vibanga) and in Buddhist art (such as, here, at Borobudur) for millennia, perpetuating a (mis)understanding of Karma which has persisted to today.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="abduction-of-queen-kakati_patrick-kit" %}
- But, as Buddhism became more popular and spread around and out of India, it also picked up an artistic and mythological richness that textured and enlivened the tradition. Indeed, Buddhism’s ability to embrace and contextualize local mythology has long been a key to its ability to spread peacefully.
- The story behind [this ancient, Buddhist statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gandhara,_garuda_adduce_la_regina_kakati,_periodo_kushan_200-400.JPG){:target="_blank"}.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="narratives-of-buddhist-relics-and-images_berkwitz-s" %}
- Such foreign converts often yearned for a solid connection back to the Buddha. One common expression of this was the creation and authentication of local "souvenirs" which also play a prominent role in popular Buddhism to this day.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="true-dhamma-has-disappeared_geoff" %}
- In addition to new relics and stories explaining them, many new teachings were also introduced. Today, as all the remaining traditions have picked up their fair share of shady teachers, deity cults, and doctrinal confusion, Ajahn Geoff reminds us that we have to be discerning about where we place our faith.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 6: Socialization for Death
{:.mb-0}
- What effect does Buddhism's encouragement to reflect on death and impermanence have on how Buddhists perceive the cosmos, life, and the religion itself?

##### After Chapter 6 of Robinson on “Vajrayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="mudras_tricycle" %}
- Taking an important role during the later development of Buddhist art and esoterica, mudras such as the “Anjali” of respect are now ubiquitous in the Buddhist cultural sphere, and are nearly synonymous with Buddhism itself.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="story-of-the-horse-king_appleton" %}
- One story, five countries.
- Shows how each nation where Buddhism spread adapted the Indic mythology to explain their own local conditions, and gives us a fascinating window into the spread of Buddhism across Asia.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 7: Social Conflict

##### Parallel to Robinson Chapters 7 and 8 on Sri Lanka and China

As we transition to more contemporary forms of Buddhism, let us set aside *Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought* for now, and take a brief listen to two Buddhists (one Sri Lankan and the other Chinese) chanting themselves to bed. Though not typical of their traditions' evening services, these two rare recordings capture, for me, something of their beauty:

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bojjhanga-suttas_dhammaruwan" %}
- First, we have this extraordinary recording of a boy in Sri Lanka spontaneously remembering how he chanted Pāli in a past life.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="drums-and-bells_qing-de" %}
- A monk at a lonely temple, deep in the mountains of Taiwan, says goodbye to the day with drum and bell.

##### Robinson Chapter 9: Korea and Vietnam

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="faxians-account-of-anuradhapura_kim-haewon" %}
- What does a Chinese monk's pilgrimage to Sri Lanka have to do with Korea?

##### Robinson Chapter 10: Japan

{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="introduction-to-buddhist-art_smith-doug" %}

##### Robinson Chapter 11: Tibet

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="reexamination-of-female-inferiority_goodwin-allison" %}
- Now that we've covered all the "traditional" forms of Buddhism, we can take a closer look at one particular element of cultural Buddhism that has been surprisingly ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures: misogyny.
- Allison Goodwin gives a brief outline of the discrimination faced by women in Buddhism, and a thoroughly cited argument for rejecting sexist views, even those that appear in the Buddhist Canon.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 8: Women's Social Role
{:.mb-0}
- We (finally) return to *Aspects*' final chapter for a look at how the Buddha originally taught women.

##### Robinson Chapter 12: “Buddhism Comes West”

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="altruism-in-classical-buddhism_lewis-todd" %}
- A brief look back at Altruism, and one tiny example of Western Philosophy grappling with Buddhism. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bridging-the-two-vehicles_bodhi" %}
- As the Dhamma comes West, and globalization connects us all, we have a unique opportunity now to bridge the gaps that history and geography created... but only if we choose to do so.

And with that, we're now finished with Part 1 of our course! **History is now yours to make!**
{:.mt-4}

### Part 2: The Sangha

Zooming in slightly from the historical perspective, we next turn our attention to the dynamics of individual Buddhist communities.

#### Introduction

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="end-of-the-buddhist-utopia_sujato" %}
- Bhante Sujato starts by asking why Buddhism died out in India, and what factors will lead to the end of our own (present day) "Buddhist Utopia"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn45.2" %}
- Joseph Goldstein reads the Buddha's own take on “the entire spiritual life.”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="going-forth_viradhammo" %}
- A beautiful sermon on the value of monasticism.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="making-buddha-statues-cultivation_drba" %}
- A video about a community coming together to make ten thousand Buddha statues by hand.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="economy-of-gifts_geoff" %}
- Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relationship between the monastic sangha and the laity in brief.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="we-love-our-nuns_mrozik" %}
- A paper on how the flourishing of the monastic community affects everyone around them.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="healing-is-possible_tnh" %}
- An inspiring talk to a group of monastics, encouraging them to set a good example for their guests.

#### Main Text

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="culture-of-awakening_cintita" %}

### Part 3: Personal Practice

The last third of our class tackles the more prescriptive, “micro” question of our own, individual practice: What should one do to be a Buddhist?

#### Textbook

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="lay-buddhist-practice_khantipalo" %}

#### Supplements

We have two supplements for *Khantipalo*:

##### Taking Refuge

Listen to this alongside the section of Khantipalo about refuge and the triple gem:

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="becoming-buddhist_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo talks about what it means to be a Buddhist, and how to think about “taking refuge”

##### Practicing Restraint

A few more words are also due on the subject of restraint, beyond the five precepts. Please consider this alongside the section on “practice”

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.239" %}
- Explains the three primary duties of a monk: guarding the senses, moderation in eating, and the devotion to wakefulness. 
- What monastic behaviors and vows do you know about already? How do the monastic and “eight precept” observances help with these three duties? What do you think is their benefit? Can lay Buddhists practice these? Should they?


#### Praxis Conclusion 

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="dhammavinaya_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo revisits [the Gotami Sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.053.than.html){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} (which you may remember from the [Intro to Buddhism Course]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %})) and tells us how we can recognize when our own practice of Buddhism goes off track.

### Conclusion to the Class

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="pseudobuddhism_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm reminds us, in his light-hearted way, that for all the traditions and books, real knowledge comes from meditation (or, as Bhikkhu Cintita put it, the joke is passed on to make us laugh).

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="dedication_longchenpa" %}
- It's common in many Buddhist cultures to end a meritorious event or auspicious occasion with a short dedication. Here is a typical such prayer from the Tibetan Tradition.
