  > With skilful means and compassion, you were born in the Śākya clan,  
  > གཞན་གྱིས་མི་ཐུབ་བདུད་ཀྱི་དཔུང་འཇོམས་པ། །  
  > Unconquerable by others, you vanquished Māra's hordes,  
  > གསེར་གྱི་ལྷུན་པོ་ལྟ་བུར་བརྗིད་པའི་སྐུ། །  
  > Your physical form resplendent, like a mountain of gold.  
  > ཤཱཀྱའི་རྒྱལ་པོ་ཁྱོད་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ། །  
  > I pay homage to you, King of the Śākyas!

## Who was the Buddha?

“Buddha” (properly speaking) refers, not to a single individual, but rather to a category of beings: those who have, through their own effort, attained complete enlightenment.

But, more typically, “_the_ Buddha” refers to the Sakyan prince who, in the 5th century BCE Gangetic Plain, first rediscovered _nibbāna_ and taught the way for attaining it.

Over 500 million people now worship the Buddha as their teacher, but the Buddha was no God. Indeed, it's even said that a Buddha can only arise as a human—never as a deity (*deva*)— because only the human realm balances the misfortunes and mistakes of life which are necessary to motivate the practice, with the ease and discernment which allow it to ripen.

But while the Buddha was born a man, a man he did not remain. Through his superior striving and wisdom (over countless eons) he was able to transcend gender, caste, creed, identities, views, suffering and even death itself and to teach others how to transcend themselves too. We call such a teacher, “Buddha.”

## Prerequisites

If you're looking for a quick and inspiring biography of the Buddha, I recommend [*The Biography of Shakyamuni Buddha* by Master Hsing Yun](/content/monographs/biography-of-shakyamuni_hsing-yun). This course goes beyond the basics to reading the primary sources themselves, and therefore requires some comfort reading [the Early Buddhist Texts](/courses/ebts).

## Course Materials

This syllabus has no associated lectures. It weaves together several, free books, mostly on the Pāli texts.

### Textbooks

#### Main Anthology

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="life-of-the-buddha_nyanamoli" %}
- This classic, quirky anthology gives a good presentation of the Canonical account of the Buddha's life. It will be the primary biography used in this course, and we will follow the book’s ordering of events.

#### Other Anthologies

To supplement Ñanamoli’s judicious selections from the Pāli Canon, we will use these anthologies to underline a couple themes I think worth dwelling on:

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="teacher-of-devas_jootla" %}
- To understand the Buddhist cosmology requires seeing the way the Gods and the Buddha related with one another.

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="buddha-my-refuge_khantipalo" %}
- While it is important to mine the Pāli literature for historical and mythological details, it is also important to not lose sight of the Buddha's extraordinary personal qualities, explained in this anthology through the nine characteristics of the Buddha.

#### Primary Texts

There's one significant primary text in this course, but it isn't an early text.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="nidanakatha" %}
- This traditional Pāli commentary contains one of the first systematic biographies of the Buddha and formed the basis for many of the later hagiographies. While not necessarily a reliable source of information about the historical Buddha himself, it is of critical importance for understanding the myths and stories about the Buddha which persist today.

#### Academic Works

A number of articles and essays will be weaved in throughout the course.  We’ll also be reading these two, free books:

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="draft-entries-for-encyclopedia-of-buddhism_harvey" blurb="A collection of Encyclopedia articles introducing the Buddha from one of the English language’s best authors of rigorous introductions." %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="genesis-of-bodhisattva_analayo" blurb="In this monograph, the renowned scholar of early Buddhism explores what the early literature can tell us about how the Buddha became the Buddha: a topic of extraordinary importance in later centuries." %}

## The Course

I've sequenced the above books into an inter-woven, narrative arc which I (at least!) find compelling. 

If I were to actually teach this course, I'd perhaps meet twice per week for 13 weeks. The readings below have been bunched together according to this hypothetical schedule, but for individual study you’re of course welcome to work through the readings as you like.
