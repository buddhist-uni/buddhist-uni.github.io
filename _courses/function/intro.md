## Lectures

Bhante Yuttadhammo will be our lecturer for this course.

His talks were largely delivered to yogis (some in-person and some online) who were doing an intensive meditation retreat. 
His talks are, therefore, more geared towards advanced practitioners despite covering the same, basic topics as our textbook.

If you haven’t tried [Bhante Yuttadhammo’s meditation style](https://www.sirimangalo.org/text/how-to-meditate/){:target="_blank"} before, you may want to give it a try now, as his talks will make more sense to those who, like his original audience, are familiar with his technique.

But, our main question here isn't just _how_ to practice meditation: it's _why_.

In this first talk, Bhante sets up this central question which will drive the rest of our course:
