## Lectures

The lecture series we'll be listening to over this course was originally delivered to meditation students at a temple in Los Angeles,
so I encourage you to do a brief meditation before each talk to "get into the mood."
And if the talks (or any of the readings) aren't useful for you, please feel free to skip them.

For most of us, the question isn't _how_ to practice meditation: it's _why_.
In this talk, Bhante sets up this central question which will drive the rest of our course:
