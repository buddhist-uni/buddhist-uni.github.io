## Homework

Before each lecture, we'll have some "homework" assignments.

For this module, please read **Chapter 1** from {% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita" %}
to learn a bit about the Buddha before coming back here to listen to the talks.

## Lectures

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="enlightenment-is-the-highest-happiness_brahm" %}
- We say that the Buddha "Awakened" and that "Nirvana" is the goal of the Buddhist practice, but what does that even mean? What is "Enlightenment" anyway?

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="kalyanamitta_yuttadhammo" %}
{% include inline-av-player.html content="kalyanamitta_yuttadhammo" %}
- What makes someone a "good friend?" And why is good friendship "the whole of the holy life?"
