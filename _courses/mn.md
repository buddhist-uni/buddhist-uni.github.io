## What is the Majjhima Nikāya?

The Majjhima Nikāya (or Middle Length Discourses) are a canonical collection of stories about early Buddhism preserved in the Pāli Canon of the Theravada tradition. These stories are neither as condensed as the poetry collections or Connected Discourses (which were stripped of much of their narrative context by the redactors) nor are they as elaborate as the (more mythological) Lengthy Discourses.

Traditionally, the Majjhima Nikāya (or MN for short) would have been a primary subject of study for new monks. The first ten discourses in particular would have been memorized (!) and analyzed in depth to form the foundation for the novice’s continued study and practice. As such, the MN strikes a nice balance between assuming intelligence and spiritual earnestness on the part of the reader (unlike, for example, the more family-friendly Jataka tales) without assuming too much in the way of prior doctrinal knowledge (unlike, for example, the more pithy Connected Discourses).

As Western-educated rationalists, The Middle Length Discourses are also an excellent place for us to lay our foundation, as their “middle length” provides us with enough narrative framing to imagine the Buddha in his cultural and historical context, without being so mythologically grandiose as to be unpalatable to modern ears.

Finally, in addition to striking such delicate balances, the Majjhima Nikāya also contains many individual suttas of such extraordinary depth and profound beauty as to be worth reading and rereading, pondering and savoring again and again, strictly on their own literary merits, let alone for the critical part they serve on the path to Awakening.

## Prerequisites

This course requires prior familiarity with [Buddhism]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}) and [its purpose]({% link _courses/function.md %}).

## Time Requirement

This course is quite long if you hope to complete it. But don't worry: each of [the modules](/series/mn-study_bodhi) (not to mention each sutta) is a fairly self-contained unit and can be studied independently based on your interests.  Feel free to pick and choose as you like!

For those looking to take the _entire_ course, I recommend setting aside **a few hours per week** to study the Majjhima Nikaya — perhaps Wednesdays, Sundays, or [Uposatha Days](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/uposatha.html){:target="_blank"} — whatever works for you.
Make these days a special “holy” day, dedicated to your practice and study. Read one sutta, listen to the lecture(s) on it and reflect.
Take your time. Meditate on it. Let this weekly ritual become part of your life. If you keep it up, in a few years you may even be sad to know that you've finished the course!

## Course Content

In this course, we study the Early Buddhist Texts by reading the Majjhima Nikaya.

I recommend first reading [Ajahn Sujato’s Guide to the Majjhima Nikaya](https://suttacentral.net/mn-guide-sujato){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"} if you haven't already, to orient yourself, and listen to [the introductory lecture by Bhikkhu Bodhi](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qjrsRECWOw1_mPBAZAUz5PjnDtL5sftC/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} to get a sense of what to expect from this course.

### Textbook

The main text for this course is *The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha* by Bhikkhu Ñānamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi published by [Wisdom Publications](https://wisdomexperience.org/product/middle-length-discourses-buddha/){:target="_blank"}, some of which has been released for free:

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="mn-selections_nyanamoli-bodhi" %}


For the suttas not included in the free anthology above, or to get an alternative translation, please also refer to the complete, free translation by Bhante Sujato: 

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="mn_sujato" %}

All of which can be accessed online at [SuttaCentral.net](https://suttacentral.net/mn/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Optional: About the Texts

Advanced students, interested in engaging with the history and Northern versions of the texts, may want to read Bhante Analayo's comparitive studies after each sutta:

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="mn-comparison_analayo" %}

If you're anything like me, you'll be amazed at how little the recensions differ, despite the thousands of miles and many hundreds of years between them. This striking congruence gives us solid confidence that the Majjhima Nikaya was well preserved.

### Lectures

Bhikkhu Bodhi will be your lecturer for this course. [His lectures have been arranged thematically into nine parts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JlG4P34WCAIMugD3WFcOrndq2pc1P7zO){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"} and do **not** go sequentially through the collection— until [parts 10](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1dK_tE9gHPRxP-rgkEbnlWG0NKd-3_1D8){: target="_blank"} and ["11" (on YouTube)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23DE0292227250FA){:target="_blank"}, which do go back and cover all the skipped suttas. 

#### Instructions

Look ahead to the next lecture to see which sutta comes next (the first lecture, for example, is called “[M0001 MN-026 - Ariyapariyesana Sutta - The noble search.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bwnTOwD5jqtZUW9k1r8MdiNY9ndoDTLE/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}” so you know to read [the 26th discourse](https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/bodhi){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} first). Then follow these steps:

1. Read (or [listen to](https://www.paliaudio.com/majjhima-nikaya){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}!) the sutta before class. 
1. Listen to the lecture(s) associated with that sutta.
1. Optionally, look up the sutta in Bhikkhu Analayo's *Comparative Study* to see how the Chinese (and other) parallels might enrich (or simplify!) our understanding of the Pāli text.
1. Cross that sutta off your [checklist](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/sutta-checklists-for-tracking-reading-suttas/){:target="_blank"}
1. Repeat the above for the next sutta in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lecture series.

In this way, you'll start to develop the ability to read and understand the suttas independently.

You may eventually find yourself not needing to rely so much on Bhikkhu Bodhi’s commentary, and understanding the suttas on your own. If so, congratulations! You're reading the suttas! Feel free to drop the lectures if they cease being useful.  That means you've "graduated" <i class="far fa-laugh-beam"></i>

## Referring Back

As you deepen your study of Buddhism, you may (nay, should!) find yourself referring back to the Majjhima Nikaya often. This “course” can also be used in that way: as a reference to be touched as needed. The lecture series (and Bhante Analayo's comparative study) contains every sutta, so whichever you're interested in learning more about, you'll find above.

Either (as a course or as a reference) is an appropriate use of this material. Feel free to jump in directly to the section of Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lectures relevant to your current interests, or refer to Bhante Analayo’s notes to see how a curious Pāli passage compares to its parallels. There are many uses for this material and I encourage you to make it your own!

In case it's useful for such referencing, here's an index of the suttas by their Pāli name:

{% include content_blurb.html category="reference" slug="mn-pali-name-index" %}
- Many suttas in the MN are often referred to by their Pali name. If you have trouble finding them, here is an index from Pāli names to their traditional placement within the Majjhima Nikaya (usually noted as “MN #”, e.g. “MN 3” for the third sutta)

And, again, I recommend keeping a [checklist](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/sutta-checklists-for-tracking-reading-suttas/){:target="_blank"} (or [diary](https://readingfaithfully.org/personal-sutta-anthology/){:target="_blank"}) of which suttas you've read, so you know where to come back to later.

Happy Reading!
