description: "A short course on part of the Madhyama Āgama held in 2013, the sutras covered (MA 72-86) revolve around the interdependence of _samatha_ and _vipassana_ meditation and their co-creation of wisdom.  Bhikkhu Anālayo makes the difficult subject accessible in his inimitably methodical style."

  - "If you're enjoying studying the Middle Length Discourses and comparing Pāli and Āgama texts, you can continue with Bhikkhu Anālayo and Bhikkhu Bodhi in this course focusing more on the Pāli canon."
  - "Continue to learn about the results of successful meditation practice."
  - "Wisdom forms both the foundation for successful meditation practice and also its goal."
  - "The path to developing wisdom encompasses more than just meditation practice, however. In this course we explore the various ways that the developmental stages have been talked about, both in the early texts and in later exegesis."
  - "The final culmination of tranquility and insight is the cessation of all the corruptions."

## What are tranquility and insight?
Tranquility and insight are the two proximate goals of Buddhist meditation. When you meditate on a single thing, the mind will eventually become calm and collected. We call this _samatha_ or tranquility meditation.  If you meditate on the three characteristics---that things are impermanent, unsatisfying, and not our own---wisdom will arise. We call this _vipassana_ or insight meditation.

These two kinds of practice and result support each other. Insight requires tranquility because the mind must be stable and clear to see and to accept the truth. But tranquility requires wisdom which is what lets go of our thinking and worrying long enough to meditate and to stabilize the mind.

So, as with mindfulness itself, we have to start where we are. We use whatever tranquility we have to remind ourselves  what is real and we use whatever insight we have to let go of what is bothersome. As we let go more and more, we become calmer and calmer and as we become more and more calm we are able to see more and more clearly. In this way, tranquility and insight form the two wings which together lift us out of delusion.

## Prerequisites

This course assumes a familiarity with [meditation](/tags/meditation) and [the Pāli Canon](/courses/ebts). Prior knowledge of [the Āgamas](/tags/agama) or [Chinese](/courses/chinese-primer) is not required.

The above lectures, along with their PDF notes, _are_ the course. 

## Textbook

When Bhikkhu Anālayo first taught this class in 2013, there was not yet a published, English translation of the MA sutras covered here. In 2020, however, he co-authored with Roderick Bucknell:

The first section of this book contains translations of the Madhyama Āgama Discourses covered in this course, so please feel free to reference these translations as you take the course.

## Pāli Parallels

In addition to the main Madhyama Āgama sutras above, a number of discourses from the Pāli Canon will be referenced throughout the course, mostly as parallels to the MA discourse under investigation. I've collected them below for your convenience, in the order of their appearance in the course:

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn113" %}

As you study these parallel Pāli and Āgama discourses, remember that these two recensions were separated by thousands of miles and hundreds of years. Note the similarities and differences.  How reliable do you feel the Early Buddhist Texts are now, as records of what the Buddha actually taught?
