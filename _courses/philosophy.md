  - "If you're enjoying studying the suttas with Bhikkhu Bodhi, this course continues his lectures and our reading of the Majjhima Nikaya, going thematically through half the Middle Length Discourses — a long course, by the end of which you'll have an excellent foundation in early Buddhism. And don't worry, these lectures were recorded on modern equipment and are much easier to listen to!"
  - "Dig deeper into the path of mental cultivation by which right view is realized."
  - "An important branch in any philosophy, but especially in Buddhism, this course asks how we might explain ethics especially in light of Western philosophy."
  - "Notoriously difficult to explain, and even harder to understand, and yet tremendously important, in this class we explore what can be said about the unconditioned."
  - "Dive deeper into the thought world of the Buddha’s teachings by exploring the metaphors, words and similes in the suttas."
  - "Go deeper into the ontology of thought moments and dhammas and learn why the abhidhamma is so revered by some and reviled by others."
  - "In this course, we learn about the setting of the EBTs: ancient India at the time of the Buddha and our own place in the cosmos."
  - "This course introduces the history and practical aspects of the religion."

## What is Buddhist Philosophy?

Buddhist Philosophy (right view, thought, understanding, and wisdom) is both the beginning and the end of the Buddhist Path. Without confidence in the power of action and the dangers of greed, hatred and delusion, one can only practice the path half-heartedly at best. And yet the overcoming of ignorance is itself the goal of the path. Buddhist Philosophy thus has a bootstrapping problem: how can deluded beings ever climb out of darkness?

The Buddha starts with what we can know directly: suffering. People can mislead you about many things, but when you're suffering nobody can tell you that you're not. You can directly know this first truth yourself. This gives us the self-confidence that there are truths we can directly know and it builds our confidence in the Buddha who pointed this out. Faith leads to effort, effort leads to results, and so the whole path unfolds from the basic observation of pain.

From this process we can make out a few points regarding Buddhist Philosophy. Most distinct is that it is phenomenological. Buddhist Philosophy is primarily concerned with our subjective experiences. Second, within this "event driven" rather than "object oriented" framework, we notice a distinct emphasis on cause and effect. The Buddhist universe is neither chaotic nor predetermined, but is rather conditioned by our choices. Lastly, Buddhist Philosophy is teleological. It has a goal, a purpose beyond merely describing reality. It points the way out of views, attachments, and prejudices and towards the direct understanding of reality itself.

Buddhist Philosophy is thus the way of thinking which leads beyond thought. 
 
## Prerequisites

This course assumes some familiarity with [the purpose of Buddhism](/courses/function). Prior comfort with [the Early Buddhist Texts](/courses/ebts) is not required, though may be helpful.

## Lectures

This course rests on Bhikkhu Bodhi's classic cassette tapes from 1981:

<p> {% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="as-it-is_bodhi" %} </p>

These lectures are a walkthrough of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine. I recommend *not* listening to the lectures while doing something else, but instead giving them your full attention, pausing the recording as needed to digest and reflect. It may be helpful to set aside a 1.5–2 hour time slot for the lectures once per week, to give yourself a deadline to complete your "homework" and to ensure that you can listen to the lectures undistracted. But this is just a suggestion. You're of course welcome to make your way through the material however you like.

In addition to Bhikkhu Bodhi’s formal lectures, each week contains some additional, more casual, talks by other monks and nuns.


## Textbook

In lieu of a textbook, this course will weave in the [*Selections from the Majjhima Nikaya on the Doctrine*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFOPqindN_8siED_ihfwybVAjo_Aj-cWDj2M-753-jM/edit?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank"} which Bhikkhu Bodhi recommended be required reading for studying Buddhist Philosophy. These suttas are linked to web translations, but feel free to read (or [listen to](https://www.paliaudio.com/majjhima-nikaya){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"}) the suttas in whichever translation (and medium) you prefer.

Please read the suttas and other readings on your own “before class” and spend some time reflecting on them, preferably for a day or two, before listening to the lecture. Don't feel discouraged if you find the suttas difficult at first. I'm sure you'll be a pro sutta-reader by the end of the class!

You may want to keep a copy of the assigned suttas in front of you while listening to the lectures, so that you can refer back to them and take notes as inspiration strikes, keeping in mind that the recordings (unlike live lectures!) can easily be paused.

In addition to the suttas, this course assigns four short books in weeks 4 and 9: [The Heart of Understanding](/content/monographs/heart-of-understanding_tnh) and [BuddhaDhamma for University Students](/content/monographs/buddhadhamma-for-students_buddhadasa) respectively, so be advised to budget a little extra time for the homework two weeks.


## The Course

This course gives a traditional, 10-week introduction to Theravāda Buddhist Philosophy.

It does not cover comparative philosophy or the history of philosophy and it does not attempt to present the theory from a Western frame, nor even from a practical angle. Instead, this course opts for an approach modeled on the traditional Theravāda commentaries.

My own bias, however, is towards early Buddhism. So, while the Abhidhamma Tradition (at least as presented here) doesn't stray _too_ far from the Pāli Canon, there are a couple points throughout the course where differences will be noted.

The class is structured into 10 "weeks." Each week assigns some suttas and other readings for “homework” before the main lecture for that week. Each week ends with a breakout session I call the “sutta spotlight” in which we do a closer reading of a related sutta from the _Majjhima Nikaya_ with a guest monastic, before advancing on to the homework for the following "week."

### Introduction

But before we get started, here is a brief introduction to Wisdom in Early Buddhism.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_wisdom_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- Bhante Sujato gives us a guest lecture on wisdom to start our course.
- They introduce the main points we'll analyze in depth, and also briefly explain why this course doesn't follow the “conventional versus ultimate realities” dichotomy that many have used to explain Buddhist philosophy.
- **Start here!**

### Week 1: The Buddha and the Cosmos

We start the course proper by talking about the founder and central figure of Buddhism and his important role in Buddhist Cosmology.

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn26" %}
- The Buddha's autobiography: He gives the bhikkhus a long account of his own quest for enlightenment from the time of his life in the palace up to the transmission of the Dhamma to his first five disciples.
- Don't worry if this sutta is a bit difficult to read. We'll cover the suttas enough throughout this course that you'll get the hang of reading them soon enough.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="cosmology-and-meditation_gethin" %}
- Rupert Gethin gives us a way of reading Buddhist mythology as a guide to the terrain of meditation.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="normative-function-of-metatheory_stein-zak" %}
- Zachary Stein gives us an impassioned defense of asking big questions, and refers obliquely to our own postmodern “noble search” for philosophical grounding.

#### Lecture

<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> [BB-001_The_Buddha.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DyuS47cRVBPerqvr8-RNCdqJTMbgpCT/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"}
{: .mb-0}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces us to the cosmology of Buddhism and the wondrous appearance of a Buddha in the world.

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="lions-roar_nyanamoli" %}
- In MN 12 (the second, "Greater" discourse in this booklet), the Buddha expounds the ten powers of a Tathāgata, his four kinds of intrepidity, and other superior qualities, which entitle him to “roar his lions roar in the assemblies.”
- (We'll read the "Lesser" Lion's Roar Sutta in a future lesson...)

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn12-explanation_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm teaches this sutta and gives a few stories from his time as a monk in Thailand in this wonderful and highly recommended talk. Don't miss it!

#### Essay Time

Write a page or two on which qualities of the Buddha inspire you. How would you like to be more "Buddha-like?" How does Buddhist mythology support your aspiration?

### Week 2: The Four Noble Truths

The very core of Buddhist Philosophy, this week we introduce the Buddha’s diagnosis of the spiritual disease. Because this is such an important doctrine, I have assigned slightly more homework this week than normal: an indulgence I hope you will forgive.

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="right-view-and-the-four-noble-truths_analayo" %}
- Venerable Analayo shows how the Four Noble Truths are akin to a medical treatment plan: from diagnosis to cure.

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="truth_jayatilleke" blurb="
It may be appropriate here to take a step back and ask what the Buddha meant by “Truth” in the first place.
Can we discern something about the Buddha's epistemology from his teachings?
" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn56.33" %}
- And why teach these truths anyway?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn141" %}
- The Venerable Sariputta gives a detailed analysis of the Four Noble Truths.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn63" %}
- A Bhikkhu threatens to leave the Order unless the Buddha answers his metaphysical questions. With the simile of a man struck by a poisoned arrow, the Buddha makes plain exactly what he does not teach in this sutta mentioned in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s talk below.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn44.2" %}
- And in this sutta, the Buddha explains [what](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/i-declare-only-suffering-and-its-cessation-the-buddha-indeed/31825?u=khemarato.bhikkhu){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"} he does teach.

#### Lecture

<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> [BB-002_Four_Noble_Truths.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eI2i2ioppB4NH_WFGzbgodtLbRYXlDA/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}
{: .mb-0}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a thorough treatment of suffering and introduces us to the five aggregates.

#### Sutta Spotlight

This week we've covered a lot of ground and hopefully have a firm framework off which to hang the rest of Buddhist Philosophy. We explored the Four Noble Truths and we thought about why the Buddha taught what he did and what he chose not to discuss.

This "Sutta Spotlight" shows how that "hanging together" works with a vivid example from the Canon.

But before reading this sutta, please take a moment to consider how _you_ would explain the relationship between the Four Noble Truths, the Four Material Elements, the Five Aggregates and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. How would you "fit" these teachings together?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn28" %}
- The venerable Sāriputta begins with a statement of the Four Noble Truths, which he then expounds by way of the four elements and the dependent origination of the five aggregates, showing how he fits all of the Buddha's Teachings inside the framework of the Four Noble Truths.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="greater-discourse-on-the-simile-of-the-elephants-footprint_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo gives a brief talk on this profound sutta, revealing yet another (!) layer of its profundity.

### Week 3: The Nature of Reality (The First Noble Truth)

The five aggregates of body and mind that we cling to as constituting a “self” and their nature to be impermanent, dissatisfying and uncontrollable, this week covers what the Buddha meant by “suffering.”

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="craving-dukkha_analayo" %}
- Ven Analayo defines what the Buddha meant by *dukkha* and how it fits into the Four Noble Truths.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.85" %}
- The defining characteristic of the Buddhist conception of the world is “emptiness.”
- The question immediately arises: “The world is empty of what?” In this sutta, the Buddha gives us the answer: “It is empty of a self.”
- Notice in particular in this sutta the subtle redefinition of “the world” from our usual idea of it (objective material stuff) to something altogether more subjective and (ironically) personal.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn22.59" %}
- Here we get the Buddha’s most straightforward explanation of what not-self means and its relevance to our project of overcoming suffering.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="am-i-my-khandas_cintita" %}
- Through the simile of the chariot (similar to the “Ship of Theseus” from Western philosophy), Bhikkhu Cintita explains how the five aggregates are not-self.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="mind-body-in-pali-buddhism_harvey" %}
- Mind-Body duality has long been a problem for Western philosophy. What does Buddhism have to say about the paradox of consciousness existing in a material world?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn5.10" %}
- The Bhikkhuni Vajira sums up the above in this beautiful poem.


{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn109" %}
- A bhikkhu questions the Buddha on the five aggregates, clinging, personality view, and the realization of non-self.
- This sutta will be implicitly analyzed in detail in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s third lecture below. I recommend reading it once before class and then having a copy in front of you while listening to the lecture.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="anicca_sharma-arvind" %}
- This essay gives an introduction to the three characteristics and, by analysis, their function.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="anything-you-synthesize_american-dollar" %}
- Finally, we sum up the truth of the compounded and impermanent nature of all things, with this beautiful music video on impermanence. 

#### Lecture

<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> [BB-003_Nature_of_Existence.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNj01OSKaOtW2xTFPp7bv4ITJ_iUdiTh/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}
{: .mb-0}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a detailed analysis of the five aggregates and three characteristics.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="wisdom_yuttadhammo" %}
- This is all great theory, but how do we actually *see* it? Bhante Yuttadhammo gives a very brief introduction to the four foundations of mindfulness: the way to experience the five aggregates directly.

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn140" %}
- Stopping at a potter’s workshop for a night, the Buddha meets a contemplative named Pukkusāti and gives him a profound and difficult discourse on the elements culminating in the four foundations of arahantship.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn140-explanation_sujato" %}
- Bhante Sujato walks us through this deep sutta, one of his (and, I must say, my) favorites, giving us a bit more info on the commentarial background story as well as the sutta’s parallel versions in the Mahayana Tradition.


#### Pop Quiz!

In your own words, how does seeing the Three Characteristics prepare the mind for Liberation? What does this say about the nature of Enlightenment?

### Week 4: Dependent Origination (The Second Noble Truth)

The series of causes which lead to us constitute the disease for which our suffering is only the most obvious symptom.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud1.2" %}
- Dependent Origination is the cornerstone of Buddhist philosophy, as the Buddha himself declared shortly after achieving Awakening


#### (Special Bonus!) Sutta Spotlight

Dependent Origination is a notoriously difficult concept in Buddhism, so before this week gets started in earnest, I wanted to invite Bhikkhu Brahmali here to help us understand one discourse which explains the second noble truth in this, a very special, bonus edition of “sutta spotlight”

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="toh211" %}
- We begin with the Buddha's own, pithy explanation of Dependent Arising in this Sutra preserved by the Tibetan Tradition.
{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn38" %}
- When a bhikkhu named Sāti promulgates the pernicious view that consciousness transmigrates from life to life, the Buddha reprimands him with a lengthy discourse on dependent origination, showing how all phenomena arise and cease through conditions.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn38-explanation_brahmali" %}
- Ajahn Brahmali covers this sutta in his ever-cheery style, explaining how rebirth is different from transmigration.
 
#### Homework

With that as an introduction, we're perhaps ready to read this week's homework and see how it fits together.

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="vipaka_analayo" %}
- A short article on *karma* in the the Pāli Canon.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="practical-origination_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo introduces Dependent Origination in his own way, trying to point towards its utility in practice.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sa301" %}
- This short sutra from the Chinese Canon explains another way of understanding “The Middle Way” 
- Conditionality is explained as the middle way between the extremes of seeing things as existing and non-existing. When one understands that all things are impermanent and fading away, they cannot be seen as “existing” and when the relentless arising of phenomena is seen, it cannot be held that nothing exists either. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="heart-of-understanding_tnh" %}
- An incredibly popular and influential, modern (commercial) commentary on the (Mahayana) Heart Sutra presents a much beloved take on Huayan philosophy.
- Note especially the similarities or differences to the Theravāda. How might these two perspectives on dependent origination illuminate each other?


{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="purity-of-heart_geoff" %}
- Ajahn Geoff gives a brief rebuttal to Thich Nhat Hanh and tells a short, inspiring story about his own teacher.

Before the lecture, think a bit about how studying conditionality and the three characteristics made you feel. Is Buddhist Philosophy pessimistic or optimistic or both or what?

#### Lecture

<i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i> [BB-004_Dependent_Origination.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntLjGXCK2_YidKYXv0_V7mF0sK6bYpYf/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}
{: .mb-0}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi teaches the traditional analysis of Dependent Arising. 

See:
{: .mb-0}
{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="when-does-human-life-begin_brahm" %}
for a EBT rebuttal of the influential Abhidhammic doctrine that life begins exactly at the moment of conception.

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn148" %}
- This profound and penetrating discourse explains all the factors of sense experience (the middle factors of dependent origination) as being not-self.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn148-explanation_nissarano" %}
- Ajahn Nissarano gives a relaxed talk on this sutta and on our stubborn ignorance.

#### Pop Quiz!

How does the Theravāda concept of dependent arising differ from the concept of interdependence in Thich Nhat Hanh's writing? What function does each idea serve?

### Week 5: Rebirth and Kamma (The Second Noble Truth Continued...)

Central to this wheel of origination which causes our suffering is our stubborn tendency to not die, but be reborn again and again into suffering.

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn135" %}
- The Buddha explains how kamma accounts for the fortune and misfortune of beings.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="teaching-karma_courtin-robina" %}
- Ven. Courtin describes how she introduces Karma to skeptical Westerners.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="depressive-attributional-style-not-that_liu-michelle-s-et-al" %}
- Belief that our problems are caused by our own deficiencies often contributes to depression, yet Buddhists seem immune to this effect. Why do you think that is? Is the Buddhist philosophy of Karma really "Depressive" as defined in this paper? Why or why not?

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="rebirth-and-the-west_analayo" %}
- On belief in rebirth and the Buddhist path in historical perspective.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="reincarnation_sheng-yen" %}
- A Chan Master answers a few, basic questions on reincarnation.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="paticca-samuppada_brahm" %}
- While dependent origination can be understood as describing both our moment-to-moment “rebirth” as well as our rebirth from lifetime to lifetime, many modern scholars skeptical of rebirth have tended to downplay the latter interpretation. Ajahn Brahm defends that interpretation by citing the Buddha's own analysis of the twelve factors. 


{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an5.57" %}
- The five subjects for frequent recollection

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="interview-with-dr-tucker" %}
- Dr Jim Tucker is currently the world’s foremost scientist studying spontaneous past life recall.

#### Lecture

{: .mb-0}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a detailed explanation of rebirth and kamma according to the Theravāda Abhidhamma.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn44.9" %}
- The Buddha himself explains how the interval between death and rebirth is possible and not in contradiction to Dependent Origination, *contra* the Theravāda orthodoxy.

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn42" %}
- In this sutta the Buddha explains to a group of Brahmin householders the courses of conduct leading to rebirth in lower realms and the courses leading to higher rebirth and deliverance.

#### Essay Time

Write a couple pages thinking honestly about the following questions:

What about karma and rebirth feels right to you? Which parts do you currently have a harder time accepting? Setting aside Buddhist philosophy for a moment, how do *you* imagine this whole thing works? What do you really think you'll experience after you die?

### Midterm

In lieu of our usual sutta lecture (or an exam!), here's some comedy instead to celebrate our course's midterm:
 
{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="what-you-really-want_brahm" %}

### Week 6: *Nibbāna* (The Third Noble Truth)

A completely pure mind is the end. In later philosophical traditions, this unique state of “spiritual health” came to be described in ontological terms, which we hope to clarify this week.

#### Homework

We open with some suttas from other collections than the MN, which Bhikkhu Bodhi will reference later in his lecture. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn38.1" %}
- The basic definition of *nibbāna*.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn22.86" %}
- The Buddha explains the indescribability of the Arahants.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="sixfold-purity-of-an-arahant_analayo" %}
- A thorough description of what makes someone fully enlightened.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud8.3" %}
- A short exclamation on the existence of Nibbāna. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="what-is-the-eye_cintita" %}
- Bhikkhu Cintita explains what is meant by “the eye” in the Suttas, the radical phenomenology of it, and how this can help us understand (and realize) Nibbāna.

- Bhikkhu Bodhi discusses the philosophical implications of the doctrine of Nibbāna drawn out in the Theravāda Abhidhamma

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="lions-roar_nyanamoli" %}
- In MN 11, the Buddha declares that only in his Dispensation can the four grades of noble individuals be found, explaining how his teaching can be distinguished from other creeds through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn11-explanation_suddhaso" %}
- Bhante Suddhaso explains this sutta and mentions how it relates to other philosophies.

#### Pop Quiz!

What are the two Nibbana elements (*dhatu*)?

### Week 7: The Eightfold Path (The Fourth Noble Truth)

This week we introduce the path of practice which leads to the state of mental purity. There's a number of beautiful and practical teachings this week, so I encourage you to keep track of what inspires you if you haven't been keeping a notebook already.

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an6.87" %}
- What are the prerequisites for entering the path?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn36.11" %}
- One somewhat confusing point of Buddhist philosophy is that all three feelings (painful, neutral and pleasant) are included under “dukkha.” Thankfully for us, a monk at the time of the Buddha decided to ask him about that.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn20" %}
- The Buddha outlines five methods for removing unwholesome thoughts, an important sutta Bhikkhu Bodhi will briefly talk about in his lecture.


#### Lecture

- Bhikkhu Bodhi explains the middle way, from its mundane form to the supramundane version which delivers the yogi to nibbāna.

#### Sutta Spotlight

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn75" %}
- The Buddha meets the hedonist philosopher Māgandiya and points out to him the dangers in sensual pleasures, the benefits of renunciation, and the meaning of Nibbāna.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="five-things-for-right-view_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo outlines the five preparatory factors we need to be open to the truth and to see the world from the right perspective, hopefully illuminating why Right View can be thought of as both the first and last step of the Noble Eightfold Path.

#### Essay Time

This course (Buddhist Philosophy) is focused on the first steps of the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View and Right Thought.  What are some of the nuggets of wisdom this week that inspired you? Do those ideas relate at all to the Enlightened qualities which you wrote about in Week 1? What is the relationship between thinking and being?

### Week 8: Meditation

Formal mind training is of course the hallmark of Buddhism. This course though is focused primarily on philosophy, so we'll just look this week at how to think about meditation.

#### Homework

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn43" %}
- The two suttas in this week take the form of discussions on various subtle points of Dhamma. This first sutta takes place between the venerable Mahā Koññhita and the venerable Sāriputta

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="fgbmr-address-2014_hsin-bao" %}

Think of a friend who _accidentally_ encouraged or inspired your own spiritual growth in some way.

The Buddha reprimands him and, with a series of memorable similes, stresses the dangers in misapplying the Dhamma, reminding us all to philosophize responsibly.
