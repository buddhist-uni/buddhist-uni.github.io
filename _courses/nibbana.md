## What is *Nibbāna*?

*Nibbāna* (literally: “extinguishing” or “quenching”) is the unconditional happiness and clarity of mind which is the goal of Buddhist practice. 

Rather than seeing suffering as the inevitable flip side of happiness, Buddhism sees suffering as an affliction caused by a specific condition within the heart, namely wanting the world to be other than the way that it is.  

From this angle, there are two ways to achieve happiness: forcing the world to conform to our wishes or accepting things as they are.

These two methods for achieving happiness are, of course, unequal. Getting what we want is a fleeting happiness while letting go of our neediness leads to a lasting contentment. If we are fine however things turn out, then we will always be happy. Even when death comes for us, we can remain cool and unperturbed — leaving no “unfinished business.” 

The mental “seeds” of “*I want...*” or “*I meant to...*” which normally lead us on are, in fact, only the seeds of suffering. By attending closely and continuously to the workings of our own mind, we can eventually see this directly: that grasping is painful. As this realization dawns, we naturally let go.  The radiance of insight sterilizes the seeds of discontent.

This “dhamma eye of wisdom” opens when we see for ourselves that absolutely everything is impermanent and therefore unsatisfying.  Seeing this danger in clinging to the things of the world, the practitioner begins the process of letting go. When she’s let go of everything, to her immense surprise, she experiences *nibbāna*: freedom from conditioned phenomena.

## Prerequisites

## The Course

The course will simply go sequentially through _The Island_. As you read each chapter, please refer back here for some supplemental readings and a few talks.

### Part 1: Seeds

In part one of our course, we do a deep analysis of the word "*nibbāna*" and try to understand its connotations and use. This section plants the "seeds" for our analysis of the philosophy, practice and fruits in the later sections of the course.

#### What is *Nibbāna*?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn56.21" %}
- At its core, Nibbāna is the penetrative understanding of the Four Noble Truths which ends the cycle of rebirth.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn56.23" %}
- This is also what makes someone "Enlightened"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an3.55" %}
- The other basic definition of Nibbāna is as the destruction of Greed, Hatred, and Delusion. Here, the Buddha explains how the passing of these states gives us a taste of what the ultimate is like.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud1.1" %}
- In this first utterance after he awakens, The Buddha describes what it is he awakened to: namely, dependent origination.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn12.58" %}
- And the Buddha explains here how meditation leads to the breaking of Dependent Origination (and thus, rebirth).

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> The Introduction and Chapter 1 of *Metaphor and Literalism* (hereafter, "ML")
{: .mb-0}
  - Will give an introduction to this text and to the term "*nibbāna*"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn22.54" %}
  - The sutta that, finally, explains this course's epigraph.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="nibbana_bodhi" %}
  - A standard definition and straightforward typology of Nibbāna.
  - Sometimes we will talk about nibbāna as a philosophical entity and at other times as a psychological state, or even as a meditation experience. This essay gives a good outline of these different aspects. Useful to keep in mind throughout the course, that "*Nibbāna*" can refer to a few different things!

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="snp5.10" %}
  - The beautiful sutta from which our textbook (_The Island_) gets its name.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn43" %}
  - "The Island" is, however, not the only synonym for the ultimate given in the early texts.  This chapter from the Saṃyutta Nikāya lists 43 others to give us a better idea of its character.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="synonyms-for-nibbana-from-tibet_skilling" %}
  - While sadly these forty synonyms were lost in the Chinese Tradition, Skilling shows that SN 43 (above) was preserved in Tibet.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="thig6.6" %}
  - An exultation of the Buddha and the enlightened state.

#### Fire, Heat, and Coolness

Chapter two of _The Island_ gives us the basic metaphorical image behind the term "*Nibbāna*".

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> ML: Chapter 2 - The Two Nirvana Theory
{: .mb-0}
  - A discussion of the imagery of fuel and fire, and an analysis of the important “Two Nirvana Theory” curiously left out of _The Island_. What is “The Two Nirvana Theory”? Read this chapter to find out!

And if you're still thinking that Nirvana is some heaven realm somewhere...

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="nibbana-and-the-fire-simile_nyanananda" %}
  - Bhante Ñāṇananda disabuses us of the notion that Nibbāna is a place by reminding us that "extinguishing" means the "letting go" of a fire's fuel.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="mind-like-fire-unbound_geoff" %}
  - And Ajahn Geoff further explores ancient Indian physics to come up with a striking, new (old) take on this central metaphor. A long booklet, but well worth the read.

### Part 2: Terrain

This is the main section of the course. We'll cover the rest of _Metaphor and Literalism_ and the core philosophical dimensions of *nibbāna*.

#### This, That, and Other Things

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> ML: Chapter 3 - Developments of the Two Nirvana Theory
{: .mb-0}
  - The Abhidharma Tradition took Nirvana from a metaphor and turned it into a physical reality (“dhatu”).
  - This leads to some problems, particularly how this “ultimate reality” differs from the “ultimates” postulated by other religions.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="vedanta-and-buddhism_glasenapp" %}
  - This booklet helps to answer that very question, by explaining the middle way and contrasting it to the influential Vedāntic theology.

I personally find that The Island occasionally leans on the side of eternalism (or at least doesn't argue against it to my satisfaction), so the above chapter and booklet will be especially good to read and keep in mind.

#### All That is Conditioned

We will return to Metaphor and Literalism in a few chapters, but first let us talk for a while about nibbāna’s opposites: conditioned reality and suffering (dukkha).

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an8.5" %}
  - How does an arahant relate to the world?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud7.7" %}
  - The Enlightened don't make an object of anything.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn9.6" %}
  - How does an arahant see the world?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an9.25" %}
  - An Arahant is one whose mind is consolidated and beyond conditions.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="anuruddha-sutta_ireland" %}
  - To an enlightened being, even sensual pleasures are seen as painful for how fleeting they are indeed!

#### To Be or Not to Be

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="snp5.4" %}
  - What is the difference between an Ordinary and an Enlightened being?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn21.10" %}
  - What makes one truly renounced?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="anatta-nibbana_nyanaponika" %}
  - How is “extinguishing” the Middle Way? How is it not nihilism?  How is "extinguishing" different from "annihilation"?

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="fear-of-freedom_sujato" %}
  - How is it that we both long for and fear freedom?

#### Not Made of That

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn22.48" %}
- Nibbāna can be seen as the purification of the aggregates: washing them of clinging.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.65" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.17" %}
- Nibbāna is something other than the six senses. It is the escape from them.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud8.2" %}
- Letting go is hard to see for those with craving.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="advice-on-the-worldly-concerns_dundul" %}
  - What is “non-duality” and, more importantly, how does one practice it?

#### Attending to the Deathless

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="snp5.15" %}
- Is "the deathless" the same as "nothingness"? What knowledge eradicates ignorance?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="enlightenment_yuttadhammo" %}
- An excellent, clear summary of the path and its fruit, connecting the dots between mindfulness meditation and the attaining of *nibbāna*.

#### Unsupported and Unsupportive Consciousness

**Note** *The Island*’s understanding of *Viññāṇaṁ anidassanaṁ* here as being a description of *nibbāna* is popular but incorrect (as the following essays explain)...

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="what-the-nikayas-say-about-nibbana_brahmali" %}
  - It is very important (and very difficult!) to understand that the “experience” of _nibbāna_ is no experience at all!
  - Ajahn Brahmali here argues the other side of the “debate” from _The Island_, explaining how “_anidassana viññāṇa_” should be understood, not as a hidden, pure, or non-dual consciousness, but as something else entirely...
  
{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="boundless-consciousness_sunyo" %}
- In this brilliant essay, Bhante Sunyo proposes a elegant solution to the problem in this verse.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="consciousness-where-nothing_sujato" %}
- And Ven. Sujato puts the final nail in the coffin by putting this sutta back into its historical context.

#### The Unconditioned and Nonlocality

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an3.47" %}
- A short, enigmatic description of conditioned phenomena (saṃsāra) and unconditioned phenomena (nibbāna).

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="nibbana-abhidhamma_cousins" %}
  - If experiences, not metaphysical "elements," were the point of Early Buddhism, how did _nibbāna_ develop into the “unconditioned element”?

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> _Metaphor and Literalism:_ Chapter 4 - _Nibbāna_ in the Theravāda Buddhist Tradition
{: .mb-0}
  - We return to ML and the analogy of fire in order to better understand the Theravāda developments to the doctrines of _nibbāna_ and _anatta_.

#### The Unapprehendability of the Enlightened

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="snp5.7" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn71" %}
- Even in the Buddha's day (all the more so later) people tried to attribute omniscience to the Buddha: a claim he rejected.
- In this sutta, the Buddha explains that, rather than omniscience, it's right view and renunciation that make *nibbāna* "unapprehendable" by ordinary people.

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> ML Chapter 5 - The Northern Schools
{: .mb-0}
  - If you are interested in the Northern schools of Indian Buddhism (which came to be part of the Mahayana), you may want to read Chapter 5 at this point. If you're uninterested in the Mahayana, however, you will probably want to skip this chapter of _Metaphor and Literalism_

#### 'Reappears' Does Not Apply

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an4.195" %}
- "everything becomes cool when nothing is relished"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="iti44" %}
- The two Nibbāna elements.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn35.21" %}
- The relationship between the senses and suffering.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="in-this-pure-awareness_shenga-khenpo" %}
- On what it feels like to transcend the categories

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="translating-buddha_bodhi" %}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi discusses the nature of Buddhist enlightenment in order to defend using the English term "enlightenment" to describe it at all.
- Key to his argument is that complete liberation is described as the arising of true knowledge. Once ignorance is destroyed, it will never appear again.

<i class="fas fa-book"></i> _Metaphor and Literalism:_ Conclusion and Translations
{: .mb-0}
  - The Conclusion is worth a read to tie together our study of Nirvana's history.
  - Those interested in the primary sources may also wish to read the translations in Part Two. Even a quick skim may be helpful to get a general impression of the genre, but don't worry: this part won't be on the final exam!

#### Knowing, Emptiness and the Radiant Mind

We wrap up this, the main, section of our course, with a brief word on the "Radiant Mind" and related perennial topics:

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn1.23" %}
- A short poem (which inspired the Visuddhimagga) on how the path creates “unentangled” knowledge.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="luminous-mind_analayo" %}
  - Bhikkhu Analayo gives a careful, textual study of the supposedly “luminous” nature of the mind in early Buddhism.  Is such a view supported by the early texts or is this a later development?

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="vihesa_analayo" %}
  - If the Arahants are beyond "suffering" can they still experience pain? What is the difference between the two? What about painful thoughts?

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="channa-suicide_analayo" %}
  - The curious case of an arahant committing suicide.  Can someone who has attained the goal decide to kill themselves?

### Part 3: Cultivation

The next two parts of the course shift from philosophical to more practical considerations: How is enlightenment achieved?

#### The Gradual Path

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="nature-of-the-ariya-magga_harvey" %}
  - What is the relationship between the mundane and supermundane paths? How did these concepts develop?

#### Sudden Penetration

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn44" %}
  - This deep sutta on the details of the meditative “experience” of nibbāna takes place as a discussion between the Bhikkhuni Dhammadinnā and her student, the layman Visākha.  How is “the unconditioned” conditioned?

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="mn44-explanation_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm celebrates their Bhikkhuni ordination with a talk on this sutta.

#### The Path and Goal

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="arahat_bodhi" %}
  - An introduction to the final goal of Buddhist Practice.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="snp3.6" %}
  - A wanderer asks the Buddha what it means to be truly “learned”

### Part 4: Fuition

We finally come to the last, but perhaps most important, part of our course: the experience of enlightenment itself. We will break it down into two lessons: on the first breakthrough and the final release.

#### Sotāpanna

*Sotāpanna* (or a Stream Winner) is someone who has attained the first stage of awakening. They have eliminated doubt and are firmly on the path to final deliverance.  We will conceptualize this "turning point" in the spiritual career first with this work on the stages of insight that lead **up** to Stream Entry:

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="visuddhinyanakatha_mahasi" %}
  - What does it feel like as we transition from ordinary to super-mundane practice?

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="stages-of-awakening_anandabodhi" %}
  - A short talk on balancing faith and knowledge against expectations.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="iti41" %}
  - Those without "noble wisdom" are missing out.

#### "Ah, What Bliss!" — Conclusion

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="empty-citta_mahabua" %}
  - Ajahn Maha Boowa describes what it's like to be an arahant in this short talk delivered near the end of his life.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="thag15.2" %}
  - A poetic description of the enlightened one as a spiritual "giant."

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="arahant_ireland" %}
  - A short, ecstatic poem from the SN.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="after-nibbana_yuttadhammo" %}
  - "What's next?" What happens after enlightenment?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="thag6.10" %}
  - Even children can get enlightened, though they may not show it...

With those final words of inspiration, our course is now finished.  The rest is up to us.
