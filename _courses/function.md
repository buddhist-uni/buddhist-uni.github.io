## What is the Function of Buddhism?

The Function of Buddhism is to make us happy by supporting our cultivation of virtue, mental clarity, and wisdom.

Buddhism supports this “threefold training” by providing both essential, explanatory frameworks and practical guidance. The Buddha himself called this a “Dhamma-Vinaya,” or “Philosophy-Discipline,” but we might simply call it “a way of life” because Buddhism is meant to transform our entire lives from our selfish, restless, addicted, never-satisfied “default mode,”[^defaultmode] to the pinnacle of human potential—the total eradication of suffering. 


## Prerequisites

This course strives to be a rigorous overview of Buddhism suitable for everyone—from beginners to experienced practitioners alike—and it is recommended for all.

For a softer introduction to Buddhism, see *[Buddhism 101]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %})*.

## The Course
I am satisfied that this course is both rigorous and accurate without compromising its lofty subject. 

### Main Text

This course follows the excellent textbook by Bhikkhu Cintita:

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita" %}
- A gradual guide into the heart of Buddhism.

### Introduction

This book is divided into two, unsurprising halves: Buddhist Life and Buddhist Path. These two divisions roughly follow the exterior and interior transformation of the practitioner, and also follows the gradual explanation of Buddhism, from the mundane to the transcendent, often used by the Buddha himself.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="going-forth_yuttadhammo" %}

- In this talk, Bhante Yuttadhammo gives us an overview of these two halves of Buddhism, and gives us a preview of what to expect in this course.
- To start the class, simply click on the link above and listen!
- When you're done, come back here and keep reading to continue with the course.


### Lectures

Bhante Yuttadhammo will be our lecturer for this class. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="la-course_yuttadhammo" %}

His Los Angeles Talks were originally delivered to yogis practicing [his meditation technique](https://www.sirimangalo.org/text/how-to-meditate/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="10"} (which I highly recommend), and thus has a different style than Bhikkhu Cintita’s more staid textbook, despite covering (approximately) the same material.


I have reordered and renumbered the lectures [in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6om_MKaiwvOHKUZMS-6pUEBAhAwtL06){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"} according to the chapters in “_Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path_” that they best correspond with:
1. [00 - Three Trainings (2009-03-16).mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLo1BH-LBtNIaTQ60llXTmnwHA4FYuG0/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"} 
    - This first lecture, to listen to before starting the book, explains the three-fold training which I mentioned in my definition.
2. [01 - Wrong View (2009-03-28).mp3](https://drive.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/file/d/1wWnL668_czXEY5tbugEqGgMfhkrtX_L_/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"} 
    - This lecture should be listened to after reading chapter 1 and its supplements (below).
3. and so on...

Please listen to them in this order, not chronologically.

### Supplementary Readings

To get some diversity of voices, and to enrich our understanding, we supplement each chapter in _Buddhist Life_ with some additional words. Please read the following after each chapter:

#### Part 1: Buddhist Life

##### Chapter 1

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="craving-dukkha_analayo" %}
(Which references [The Medical Analogy of the Four Noble Truths by Louis De La Vallée Poussin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVcG7UgI_-HYMYh9XqV4lG-80aU30Xmm/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.15"})
- We notice here that the Four Noble Truths parallel a medical diagnosis. In this way, we can think of the Buddha as the great “Spiritual Doctor” and his Dhamma as “medicine” which cures our spiritual ills.

(Remember at this point to go and listen to lecture number 1.)

##### Chapter 2

For "homework," please read chapter two of _Buddhist Life_ and:

{% include content_box.html category="articles" slug="giving-makes-us-happy" %}

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="generosity-first_geoff" %}

{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="enlightenment-is-the-highest-happiness_brahm" %}

(And then "attend" lecture number 2 here.)

##### Homework for Chapter 3

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="five-precepts_jayasara" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="guard-senses_hong-ci" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an3.78" %}

(Lecture 3)

##### Chapter 4
> ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’ ~ [MN 8](https://suttacentral.net/mn8/en/sujato#12.2){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}
{:.epigraph}

{% include content_box.html category="articles" slug="putting-cruelty-first_shklar-judith" %}

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="an7.6" %}

##### Chapter 5

{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="dealing-with-difficult-people_brahm" %}

##### Chapter 6

{% include content_blurb.html category="reference" slug="stages-of-enlightenment" %}
- A small chart summarizing the four stages of enlightenment mentioned in this chapter.
- These stages will come up again in more detail later. 

<i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya on Spiritual Companionship

- A short selection of suttas by Bhikkhu Bodhi, containing the basic instructions on how to wisely find and attend to spiritual friends and teachers. 
    1. [AN3.26](https://suttacentral.net/an3.26/en/bodhi){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}:  “And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served?”
    1. [AN4.32](https://suttacentral.net/an4.32/en/bodhi){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}: “These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.”
    1. [AN6.51](https://suttacentral.net/an6.51/en/sujato){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}: “How does a mendicant get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before?”
    1. [AN5.151](https://suttacentral.net/an5.151/en/sujato){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}: “Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path”

This external factor, namely good spiritual friendship, is the final (and most important) of the external factors supporting the Buddhist Path, and so concludes our discussion of “Buddhist Life” and enters us onto the path itself.

#### Part 2: Buddhist Path

Having come to the halfway point of our course, one might rightly question what makes Buddhism so different from other religions? Sure, Buddhism "puts cruelty first" and has lots of handy lists, but so far "be generous and don't do evil" sounds like pretty standard Religious Wisdom™️, no?

And that is somewhat accurate of what we've covered so far. Buddhism claims no exclusivity on teaching the good life. What Buddhism does uniquely have is the path beyond suffering. For, no matter how rich and privileged you are, no matter how nice and kind and even saintly you become, even the best life still has its ups and downs. As the Buddha explained:

> "What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?"
>  
"It has both pleasure and pain."
>  
"What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from stealing … sexual misconduct … lying, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?"
>  
"It has both pleasure and pain."
>  
*~ From [MN 79](https://suttacentral.net/mn79/en/sujato){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.25"}*

In part II, we finally turn to the Noble Eightfold Path, and the transcendant teachings.

##### Chapter 7

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="challenges-of-the-disengaged-mind_wilson-et-al" %}
- Scientists discover that people would rather electrocute themselves than be alone with their thoughts.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="how-meditation-reshapes-the-brain_lazar-sara" %}
- A neuroscientist talks about the subjective benefits of meditation and how they correlate with changes in the brain.

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="mn24" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="rathavinita_analayo" %}
- Bhikkhu Analayo summarizes and discusses this sutta in this short article.


##### Chapter 8

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="real-science_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm reassures us that Buddhism is scientific and rational, containing things that we can discover and prove in ourselves.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an10.61" %}
- The Buddha explains what fuel keeps ignorance going, and fuels the path out.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn22.101" %}
- Liberation is for one who knows and sees the origin and passing away of the aggregates, and it happens as the natural result of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path.
- Interestingly, right intention is not the desire to attain liberation, and the desire for liberation doesn't lead to liberation. Rather, cultivating renunciation, goodwill and harmlessness, and developing the mind accordingly, is the motivation that leads to nibbāna.
- While it's impossible to know “today I've made this much progress” it is possible over larger time spans to reflect and see how our practice has changed our character. 


{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="becoming-your-own-therapist_yeshe" %}
- A short series of talks and Q-and-As on Buddhist wisdom by a modern Tibetan master. 

##### Chapter 9

For most of us, what holds us back from perfecting virtue and becoming saintly ourselves is our fears and our worldly attachments. Bhikkhu Cintita skirted the emotionally charged side of this, but Bhante Yuttadhammo meets it directly in these provocative talks.

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="dhp25" %}

##### Chapter 10

In which we finally get to meditation!

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="meditation-in-buddhism_dwivedi-kedar" %}
- A short brief in a psychiatric journal summarizing the psychotherapeutic potential of Buddhist meditation.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="instructions-to-insight-meditation_mahasi" %}
- A general introduction to meditation, these instructions are applicable to whatever meditation technique you do.
- Essentially: note whenever your mind wanders, and then gently return your awareness back to the body, trying to maintain a continuity of awareness as much as possible.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="psychological-aspects-of-meditation_harvey" %}
- An academic introduction to the purpose and styles of Buddhist meditation.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="sensual-pleasures-are-painful_suchart" %}
- One of my favorite talks by my own teacher, Ajahn Suchart, which beautifully sums up the path, encouraging us all to strive for a real, lasting happiness.

##### Chapter 11

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="dependant-liberation_brahmali" %}
- Ajahn Brahmali explains how ethics and meditation naturally lead to enlightenment.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an11.2" %}
- This sutta makes the same point: If one merely focuses on ethics, and becomes consummate in ethics, the path to liberation unfolds on its own.

##### Chapter 12

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn56.11" %}
- In the Buddha's very first sermon, he tells his friends about his Enlightenment and the path he discovered for attaining it, waking up his first disciple and setting in motion the religion which continues rolling to this day.

{% include content_blurb.html slug="most-important-teaching_munindo" category="av" %}
- Ajahn Munindo talks about this sutta one [Vesāk day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesak){:target="_blank"} and explains how it can transform our lives.

- Bhante Yuttadhammo closes the course by encouraging us to make the most of our precious human life: do good, avoid evil, and purify your mind. 


*Footnotes:*

[^defaultmode]: Here, by “default mode” I refer to what [David Foster Wallace called](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"} our “natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self.” Neuroscientists have even identified a spinning, vortex of related regions in the middle of the brain which they think is responsible for this self-centered processing, which they have dubbed the “[Default Mode Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.15"}.”
