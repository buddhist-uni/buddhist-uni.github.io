## What is the Function of Buddhism?

The Function of Buddhism is to overcome delusion by supporting our cultivation of virtues, mental clarity, and wisdom.

Buddhism supports this “threefold training” by providing both essential, explanatory frameworks and practical guidance. The Buddha himself called this a “Dhamma-Vinaya,” or “Philosophy-Discipline,” but we might simply call it “a way of life” because Buddhism is meant to transform our entire lives from our selfish, restless, addicted, never-satisfied “default mode,”[^defaultmode] to the pinnacle of human potential — the total eradication of suffering. 


## Prerequisites

This course strives to be a rigorous overview of Buddhism suitable for everyone — from beginners to experienced practitioners alike — and it is recommended for all.

For a softer introduction to Buddhism, see *[Buddhism 101]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %})*.

## Course Outline
I am satisfied that this course is both rigorous and accurate without compromising its lofty subject. 

### Main Text

This course follows the excellent (if sometimes repetitive) textbook by Bhikkhu Cintita:

{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita" %}
- A gradual guide into the heart of Buddhism.

### Introduction

This book is divided into two, unsurprising halves: Buddhist Life and Buddhist Path. These two divisions roughly follow the exterior and interior transformation of the practitioner, and also follows the gradual explanation of Buddhism, from the mundane to the transcendent, often used by the Buddha himself.

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="going-forth_yuttadhammo" %}

- In this talk, Bhante Yuttadhammo gives us an overview of these two halves of Buddhism, and gives us a preview of what to expect in this course.

#### The Noble Eightfold Path

Before we begin the course proper, let’s first do a short "mini-course" to give us an overview of the Path and where we're headed:

{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="noble-eightfold-path_bodhi" %}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi’s classic introduction to the Buddhist Path.

{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="in-his-own-words_nyanamoli" %}
- Along with the Buddha's own words on the subject, as compiled by Bhikkhu Nyanamoli.


I recommend reading Nyanamoli’s anthology before Bhikkhu Bodhi’s analysis. This way, you'll get a taste of the original teachings followed closely by its elucidation. You might even bounce back and forth between the two like this:
1. Bodhi: Preface
2. Nyanamoli: What is the Dhamma? –> The Truth of Cessation
3. Bodhi: Part 1 (The Way to the End of Suffering)
4. Nyanamoli: Right View
5. Bodhi: Right View
8. …
9. Nyanamoli: In Practice and The Means
9. Bodhi: The Development of Wisdom
9. Nyanamoli: The End
9. Bodhi: Epilogue

Having thus gotten a traditional map of the Path, we can now begin exploring the terrain.

### Lectures

Bhante Yuttadhammo will be our lecturer for this class. 

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="la-course_yuttadhammo" %}

His [Los Angeles Talks](https://static.sirimangalo.org/diraudio/Yuttadhammo/Los%20Angeles%20Course/) were originally delivered to yogis practicing [his meditation technique](https://www.sirimangalo.org/text/how-to-meditate/) (which I highly recommend), and thus has a different style than Bhikkhu Cintita’s more staid textbook, despite covering (approximately) the same material.


I have reordered and renumbered the lectures [in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6om_MKaiwvOHKUZMS-6pUEBAhAwtL06) according to the chapters in “_Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path_” that they best correspond with:
1. [00 - Three Trainings (2009-03-16).mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLo1BH-LBtNIaTQ60llXTmnwHA4FYuG0/view?usp=drivesdk)
    - This first lecture, to listen to before starting the book, explains the three-fold training which I mentioned in my definition.
2. [01 - Wrong View (2009-03-28).mp3](https://drive.google.com/a/u.northwestern.edu/file/d/1wWnL668_czXEY5tbugEqGgMfhkrtX_L_/view?usp=drivesdk)
    - This lecture should be listened to after reading chapter 1 and its supplements (below).
3. and so on...

Please listen to them in this order, not chronologically.

### Supplementary Readings

To get some diversity of voices, and to enrich our understanding, we supplement each chapter with some additional words. Please read the following after each chapter:

#### Part 1: Buddhist Life

*Chapter 1*

{% include inline_content.html category="articles" slug="craving-dukkha_analayo" %}
(Which references [The Medical Analogy of the Four Noble Truths by Louis De La Vallée Poussin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVcG7UgI_-HYMYh9XqV4lG-80aU30Xmm/view?usp=drivesdk))
- We notice here that the Four Noble Truths parallel a medical diagnosis. In this way, we can think of the Buddha as the great “Spiritual Doctor” and his Dhamma as “medicine” which cures our spiritual ills.

*Chapter 2*

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="generosity-first_geoff" %}

*Chapter 3*

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="five-precepts_jayasara" %}

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="guard-senses_hong-ci" %} 

*Chapter 4*
> ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’ ~ [MN8](https://suttacentral.net/mn8/en/sujato#11.6)

{% include content_box.html category="articles" slug="putting-cruelty-first_shklar-judith" %}

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="an7.6" %}

*Chapter 5*

{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="dealing-with-difficult-people_brahm" %}

*Chapter 6*

{% include inline_content.html category="reference" slug="stages-of-enlightenment" %}
- A small chart summarizing the four stages of enlightenment mentioned in this chapter.
- These stages will come up again in more detail later. 

<i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya on Spiritual Companionship

- A short selection of suttas by Bhikkhu Bodhi, containing the basic instructions on how to wisely find and attend to spiritual friends and teachers. 
    1. [AN3.26](https://suttacentral.net/an3.26/en/bodhi): “And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served?”
    1. [AN4.32](https://suttacentral.net/an4.32/en/bodhi): “These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.”
    1. [AN6.51](https://suttacentral.net/an6.51/en/sujato): “How does a mendicant get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before?”
    1. [AN5.151](https://suttacentral.net/an5.151/en/sujato): “Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path”

This external factor, namely good spiritual friendship, is the final (and most important) of the external factors supporting the Buddhist Path, and so concludes our discussion of “Buddhist Life” and enters us onto the path.

#### Part 2: Buddhist Path

Having come to the halfway point of our course, one might rightly question what makes Buddhism so different from other religions? Sure, Buddhism "puts cruelty first" and has lots of handy lists, but so far "be generous and don't do evil" sounds like pretty standard Religious Wisdom™️, no?

And that is somewhat accurate of what we've covered so far. Buddhism claims no exclusivity on teaching the good life. What Buddhism does uniquely have is the path beyond suffering. For, no matter how rich and privileged you are, no matter how nice and kind and even saintly you become, even the best life still has its ups and downs. As the Buddha explained:

> "What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?"
>  
"It has both pleasure and pain."
>  
"What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from stealing … sexual misconduct … lying, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?"
>  
"It has both pleasure and pain."
>  
*~ From [MN 79](https://suttacentral.net/mn79/en/sujato){:target="_blank"}*

In part II, we return to the Noble Eightfold Path, and to the teachings on transcending _all_ suffering.

*Chapter 7*

{% include inline_content.html category="essays" slug="real-science_brahm" %}
- Ajahn Brahm reassures us that Buddhism is scientific and rational, containing things that we can discover and prove in ourselves.

*Chapter 8*

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="an10.61" %}
- The Buddha explains what fuel keeps ignorance going, and fuels the path out.

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="sn22.101" %}
- Liberation is for one who knows and sees the origin and passing away of the aggregates, and it happens as the natural result of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path.
- Interestingly, right intention is not the desire to attain liberation, and the desire for liberation doesn't lead to liberation. Rather, cultivating renunciation, goodwill and harmlessness, and developing the mind accordingly, is the motivation that leads to nibbāna.
- While it's impossible to know “today I've made this much progress” it is possible over larger time spans to reflect and see how our practice has changed our character. 


{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="becoming-your-own-therapist_yeshe" %}
- A short series of talks and Q-and-As on Buddhist wisdom by a modern Tibetan master. 

*Chapter 9*

For most of us, what holds us back from perfecting virtue and becoming saintly ourselves is our fears and our worldly attachments. Bhikkhu Cintita skirted the emotionally charged side of this, but Bhante Yuttadhammo meets it directly in these provocative talks.

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="dhp25" %}

*Chapter 10*

In which we finally get to meditation!


{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="habits-towards-nibbana_santussika" %}

{% include inline_content.html category="essays" slug="instructions-to-insight-meditation_mahasi" %}
- A general introduction to meditation, these instructions are applicable to whatever meditation technique you do.
- Essentially: note whenever your mind wanders, and then gently return your awareness back to the body, trying to maintain a continuity of awareness as much as possible.

{% include inline_content.html category="essays" slug="sensual-pleasures-are-painful_suchart" %}
- One of my favorite talks by my own teacher, Ajahn Suchart, which beautifully sums up the path, encouraging us all to strive for a real, lasting happiness.

*Chapter 11*

{% include inline_content.html category="essays" slug="dependant-liberation_brahmali" %}
- Ajahn Brahmali explains how ethics and meditation naturally lead to enlightenment.

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="an11.2" %}
- This sutta makes the same point: If one merely focuses on ethics, and becomes consummate in ethics, the path to liberation unfolds on its own.

*Chapter 12*

{% include inline_content.html category="essays" slug="fundamentals-of-buddhism_panyavaddho" %}
- A transcript of a conversation with Ajahn Panyavaddho.
- Beyond being a nice recap of what we've covered in the course, I feel something of the wisdom and compassion of enlightenment coming through in the light-hearted sincerity of this exchange

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="iti93" %}
- And lastly, a short poem on enlightenment from the Canon.


### Conclusion

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="this-opportunity_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo closes the course by encouraging us to make the most of our precious human life: do good, avoid evil, and purify your mind.
