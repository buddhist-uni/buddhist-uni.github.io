## What is Buddhist Ethics?

Buddhist Ethics is the training in virtuous conduct beloved by the Noble Ones. Its core principle is non-cruelty: the abstaining from all intentional harm.

The grossest forms of cruelty are the ethical precepts common to all Buddhists and to most other religions besides: the renunciation of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxication. The Buddha's instructions, however, continue far beyond such perennial philosophy: to guarding the senses, the development of positive moral character, and (eventually) to the complete eradication of the underlying tendencies towards greed, hatred and delusion which cause cruelty in the first place. 

The Buddha's teachings on how to live thus outline a system of transformation which is aimed at awakening — powerful tools for us to use to transform our habits of body, speech, and mind so that they might both afford and accord with liberating insight.

## Prerequisites

Prior familiarity with Buddhism will be helpful but is not necessary for this course.

## Textbooks

There are two textbooks for this class: one dry and one wet.

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="intro-to-ethics_harvey" %}
- This classic textbook covers a surprising breadth of subjects and perspectives in Buddhist Ethics in admirably clear and precise prose.
- It will supply the “dry” explanations for this course. You can think of Harvey as our lecturer: elucidating the meaning and providing a solid grounding for our course.

Our "wet" textbook is the Sanskrit classic:
{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="bodhisattvacaryavatara_santideva" %}
- This epic poem on grasping firmly the intention to awaken has inspired many generations of Buddhists (myself included) to live a more ethical and spiritual life and it captures beautifully the aesthetic of Buddhist ethics. Well worth reading again and again and again.
- There are a few English translations of this classic of world literature. Stephen Batchelor has a translation available [online here](https://www.tibethouse.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bodhisattvas_way_English.pdf){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"} for free, but I strongly recommend the Padmakara translation published by Shambhala in 2011 for its unparalleled accuracy and force. 

## The Course

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="what-work-is_levine-philip" %}

We start the course with this poem by American poet Philip Levine. Go ahead and click the link above now to read the poem. Think about its last line. What _is_ work?

For the Buddha's answer to this question, see:

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="kp9" %}

### Part 1: Foundations

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="an5.172" %}

The core of Buddhist Ethics is summed up well in this pithy sutta.  The five qualities listed here are called "The Five Precepts" and all Buddhists strive to preserve them.  Technically, observing these five moral precepts assiduously is sufficient to be considered an ethical person.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="vv1.12" blurb="
- Indeed, holding to generosity and the five precepts is believed to be a ticket to rebirth in heaven.
" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an8.40" blurb="
- While failing to uphold them leads... elsewhere in Saṃsāra...
" %}

If Buddhist Ethics can be summarized so quickly, why a whole course?  What challenges do you see in trying to observe these Five Precepts? Are there any ethical issues you think they don’t cover?


#### Analyzing the Five Precepts

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="five-precepts_vajirananavarorasa" %}
- This booklet by a former Supreme Patriarch (think, "Pope") of Thailand gives a traditional analysis of the Five Precepts, unpacking the many layers of meaning inside each point.

#### Chapter 1: *The Shared Foundations of Buddhist Ethics*

The course will follow the sequence of the chapters in Harvey's *Introduction*.  Go ahead and read Chapter 1 now, and when you're finished consider this:

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="ptsd-in-the-slaughterhouse" %}
- If you make your living off immorality, it takes a huge toll on your mind, relationships, and health.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="what-the-buddha-would-not-do_analayo" %}
- What kinds of things do liberated beings _never_ do? And why not?

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="smoking_dhammika" %}
- Bhante Dhammika demonstrates Buddhist ethical thought for us by examining the question of smoking within—and beyond—the framework of the five precepts.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_ethics_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- A lecture introducing Buddhist Ethics, particularly from the perspective of early Buddhism.

### Part 2: Cultivating Virtue

{% include content_box.html category="articles" slug="cultivation-of-virtue_fink-charles" %}

In this half of the course, we focus on the cultivation of virtue.  What mental states make virtue?  What beliefs enable such virtuous mental states?

To help us explore these questions, we'll turn to the Tibetan Tradition's favorite poem:

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="bodhisattvacaryavatara_santideva" %}

This entire half of the course technically covers only Chapter 2 of Harvey but really centers on The *Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra*.

A free version is linked above, but there are a number of better (copyrighted) translations available, including [the Padmakara edition](https://www.shambhala.com/the-way-of-the-bodhisattva.html){:target="_blank"} published by Shambhala.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="buddhist-ethics-and-the-bodhicariyavatara_garfield" %}
- Philosopher Jay Garfield talks about how he got into Buddhism from Western philosophy and shares with us what he finds so compelling about this particular text.

Your chosen translation of the text may have a good introduction and, if so, you may want to read that now. But if not, this introduction is good for our purposes:

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="ethics-in-indian-and-tibetan-buddhism_goodman-charles" %}
- An encyclopedia entry on Indian and Tibetan Buddhism which lays the groundwork for our reading of this beloved classic.

With that by way of introduction, let's now read *Śāntideva* himself! Preferably twice! Seriously, it's that good.

Your first time, I recommend reading it all the way through.  Let the poetic language, imagery and structure work their magic on you.  After reading it once for feel, go back and reread the book chapter-by-chapter with the additional readings below to put the work into dialogue with the Theravāda tradition.

#### The Way of the Bodhisattva

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="to-be-a-bodhisattva_garfield-jay" %}
- This, more detailed, introduction to Śāntideva's work discusses its overall structure and phenomenological approach to ethics and how it breaks the mold of Western ethical categories.

##### Chapter 1: *The Excellence of Bodhicitta*

In Buddhism, the highest good is awakening, and in this chapter Śāntideva expresses his devotion to that ideal and honors those who are advanced on the path towards to. This raises two questions:

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="cessation-and-axiology_breyer-daniel" %}
- What makes awakening good?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn3" %}
- How (and why) did the Buddha suggest that we pay him homage?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="iti76" %}
- The Buddha famously said that good friendship is the whole of the holy life. This poem from the Buddha explains that point whilst (oddly?) encouraging (?) us to desire fame and fortune.

##### Chapter 2: Confession

Accepting our faults is a critical starting point for ethical development, and a practice that the Buddha talked much about:

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an5.249" %}
- The Buddha compares an unethical person to a charnel pit to point out the downsides of unethical conduct.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an8.14" %}
- How do you react when someone criticizes you? Can you recognize yourself or someone you know in each of these eight ways?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn15" %}
- Venerable Mahā Moggallāna lists 16 qualities that make someone easy to admonish.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn42.8" %}
- The Buddha points out that even a killer only spends a small amount of their time actually killing, pointing out how hard it is to know ourselves—and how easy it is to delude ourselves!

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="thag1.45" %}
- But one who picks themselves back up after stumbling is a true disciple of the Buddha.

##### Chapter 3: Taking Hold of Bodhicitta

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ud5.1" %}
- A Queen gives her King a shockingly honest answer, prompting the Buddha to teach "The Golden Rule"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn46" %}
- A rather remarkable sutta, in which the Buddha admits that it's often painful to strictly follow the precepts.
- Given that following the precepts sometimes leads to pain, why does the Buddha still recommend them?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn1.78" %}
- Shantideva wishes in this chapter to become "the very medicine itself" for sentient beings, but here the Buddha tells us *not* to "give away" ourselves. How do you understand this contradiction?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="dana_bodhi-et-al" %}
- The cornerstone of Buddhist morality is generosity, for all other virtues start in its renunciation and care for others. But clearly there are better and worse ways to give, as rich people often demonstrate. What factors make giving better or worse?

##### Chapter 4: Carefulness

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn47.19" %}
- How does the Buddha advise that we care for others?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn9.14" %}
- The standard for "refraining from taking that which was not given" can be extremely high!
- From the perspective of the Buddhist path, what is so blameworthy about "stopping to smell the roses?"

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn41" %}
- People often accuse Theravāda Buddhism of focusing only on strict, negative ethics, but I find it helpful to know what not to do.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="ten-wholesome-actions_suchart" %}
- But this reputation isn't wholly deserved, as Ajahn Suchart points out here that there are a number of good things Theravāda Buddhism encourages.
{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an10.69" %}
- While these guidelines were delivered to the monastic community, they serve even laypeople with a high bar to strive for in terms of "right speech."
- **Homework** How might you turn a "low" conversation into a "high" conversation?

##### Chapter 5: Vigilant Introspection

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="two-questions-on-ethics_jayasaro" %}
- Ajahn Jayasaro answers two common questions on the five precepts, including whether it breaks the precepts to have a glass of wine for your health.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn5" %}
- As we improve our conduct and remove our blemishes, humility might seem to dictate that we don't acknowledge our increasing virtue.  What harm can come from refusing to accurately assess our purity?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn61" %}
- In one of the most famous similes of the canon, the Buddha encourages his son to constantly watch his own behavior to see what it reveals about his heart.

##### Chapter 6: Patience

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ma25" %}
- The Buddha never condoned anger, but what can we do if anger does arise?

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="youre-not-a-bad-person_kashtan-miki" %}
- We can improve ourselves and the world without anger or guilt.

##### Chapter 7: Diligence

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="cloth-and-effacement-suttas_nyanaponika" %}
- Two of the most important suttas on Buddhist Ethics in the whole canon, translated with helpful notes.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="ten-unwholesome-actions_suchart" %}
- Whenever we lose our diligence, it shows us where we lack wisdom. Where we have wisdom, we will have ease and prosperity.

##### Chapter 8: Meditative Concentration

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="reflections-on-the-eight-precepts_jayasaro" %}
- Why is Zen so minimalistic? Why take on the practice of celibacy or reduced eating?

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an10.54" %}
- What kinds of people are better not associated with? What kinds of places are better left behind?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="nourishing-the-roots_bodhi" %}
- And what does all this have to do with enlightenment anyway?

##### Chapter 9: Wisdom

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn39" %}
- What qualities distinguish the wise?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="exposition-of-nonconflict_nyanamoli" %}
- What is the highest external virtue?  How can we avoid conflict in this world?

##### Chapter 10: Conclusion

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an10.73" %}
- The Buddha summarizes the good things in life and how to get them.


What did you think going through *The Way of the Bodhisattva* a second time? Was anything new?  How does it compare to the philosophy of the Pali Suttas? Did you notice any significant differences?

At this point you should now have a firm grasp of Buddhist Ethics.  For our "Midterm Exam", write an essay comparing Buddhist Ethics to the popular ethics of your own culture. What do they agree on? Where do they diverge?

### Part 3: Engaging the World

Now that we've finished Parts 1 and 2, we've covered the core of Buddhist Ethics and can revisit Philip Levine:

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="what-work-is_levine-philip" %}
- Rereading the poem now, has your understanding changed at all since we started the course? How would you now explain what work is?

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="you-can-have-it_levine-philip" %}

In Part 3 we return to Peter Harvey's *Introduction* and, chapter by chapter, engage in a number of topical, ethical debates, starting with the Mahayana's twist on Buddhist ethics already alluded to earlier in our comparison of the *Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra* to the Pāli Canon.  As we go through this part of the course, please keep in mind the radical openness of our second Philip Levine poem, "You can have it."  How can we use our heart to check our intellect and our culture's typical way of doing things?

#### Chapter 3: Mahayana Adaptions

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="considerations-and-criteria_patrul" %}
- An introduction to Mahayana Ethics from within the tradition, and an excellent set of caveats to keep in mind as we ethically navigate our own lives.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="compassionate-killing_gethin" %}
- A Theravāda response to the Mahayana assertion of the existence of compassionate killing.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="trolly-car-dilemma_pandita" %}
- Ven Pandita tackles the famous “Trolly Problem” from the perspective of Theravāda Ethics, and illuminates a way in which Theravāda and Mahayana ethics might agree more than you think.

#### Chapter 4: Natural World

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="the-green-pill" %}
- An interview about [carnism](https://carnism.org/carnism/){:target="_blank"} and the importance of mindfulness in living green and ethically.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="task-for-mindfulness_analayo" %}
- Mindfulness practices may be essential for facing climate change.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="climate-change-ethics-and-the-field-of-greed_von-der-heyde-victor" %}
- Especially as Buddhists can use their practice to set a good example for others.

#### Chapter 5: Economics

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn17.5" %}
- In which the Buddha compares attachment to wealth to a dung beetle proud of her dung.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="buddhist-approach-to-economics_jayasaro" %}
-  A Buddhist monk who rejects money has a lot to say about economics, perhaps because of the objectivity that distance affords.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="mn96" %}
- In which the Buddha thoroughly rejects the ancient Indian caste system. 

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="iyothee-tass_dhammika" %}
- The Tamil reformer who turned to Buddhism as a refuge from the current Indian caste system.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="refugees-and-fearlessness_kilby-christina" %}
- There is a profound connection between internal states of delusion and macroeconomic problems.

#### Chapter 6: War and Peace

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="war-and-peace_bodhi-geoff" %}
- An argument between two highly respected Theravāda monks on the subject of whether war can ever be justified, Bhikkhu Bodhi wonders out loud, “War: what _is_ it good for?” and Thanissaro Bhikkhu responds with, “Absolutely nothing!”

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="an10.30" %}
- What do you make of the King's behavior here? Is he a sincere Buddhist? And what do you think of the Buddha's reaction?

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="war-bright-and-dark_sujato" %}
- Bhante Sujato replies to Bhikkhus Bodhi and Thanissaro, reminding them that the Buddha's ethical tetralemma avoids such harsh dualities as "should" and "must not"

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="integral-critical-approach_magee-rhonda" %}
- An African American law professor gives a master class in nonviolent communication.

Note: Sadly, Harvey's *Introduction* doesn't include a chapter explicitly on racism — a notorious blind spot for Buddhists both East and West which the Buddha himself pulled no punches in denouncing.

#### Chapter 7: Suicide

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="suicide_analayo" %}
- An early Buddhist perspective on suicide.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="euthanasia_yuttadhammo" %}
- A Theravāda answer to the question of euthanasia.

Do you agree with their answers?  What do you think makes the subject so uncomfortable?

#### Chapter 8: Abortion

Speaking of uncomfortable!

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="when-does-human-life-begin_brahm" %}
- A Theravāda monk gives an important clarification on the early Buddhist perspective on abortion and IVF, which later (conservative) texts have muddled in their quest for clear, crisp lines.

#### Chapter 9: Sexual Equality

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="men-explain-things_solnit-rebecca" %}
- Not Buddhist *per se*, but a contemporary classic, this essay shows exactly what casual sexism feels like.

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="thig14.1" %}
- Bhikkhuni Subha comes up with an extraordinary (if not recommended!) way of handling more serious sexual harassment, showing that women have long had to deal with the same problems.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="for-the-bhikkhunis-of-perth_kramer-jacqueline" %}
- But that doesn't mean that things can't or don't get better. This letter celebrates one such step towards gender equality taken in recent years.

#### Chapter 10: Sexuality

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="out-of-the-ordinary_dhammika" %}
- The story of a pioneering, transgender Buddhist, and a word on how Buddhism's attitude towards transgenderism differs from that of the monotheistic religions.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="being-different-with-dignity_cheng-fung-kei" %}
- Buddhists are mostly accepting of homosexuality: especially in comparison to other religions.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhism-and-sex_walshe" %}
- A refreshingly humble and non-dogmatic essay on everyone's favorite topic, embodying the spirit of [generous orthodoxy](https://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/09-generous-orthodoxy){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"}.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="gay-tragedy_dhammika" %}
- A reminder that what we say matters.

### Conclusion

Ajahn Brahm concludes by reminding us that between all the ethical debates and traditions and forms, there is a common core of good sense which we can rely on:
