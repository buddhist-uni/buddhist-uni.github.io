## What is Chinese Buddhist Writing?

Starting with haphazard translations of Indian Sutras and culminating in majestic works of literature and philosophy, texts written in Chinese characters have long been crucial to the development of Buddhism in China---and by extension all of East Asia.

But Sanskrit and Pali are very different languages from Chinese. Chinese is not inflected, largely monosyllabic and has a vastly different phonology and cosmology.  This made the job of translating Indian Sūtras into Chinese writing very difficult, and thus makes our job deciphering their work just as tricky.

But, just as translating the Buddha's words into Chinese enriched Chinese society, so too do the Chinese Buddhist Texts enrich ours when translated into English. 

## Introduction

This course teaches you how to read Buddhist texts in Chinese.

Note that this course is still a work in progress by its author, John Kieschnick.  The copy presented here is up-to-date as of December 2020, but you should check out [Professor Kieschnick's original webpage](https://religiousstudies.stanford.edu/primer-chinese-buddhist-writings){:ga-event-value="1"} to be sure you get the latest materials.

### Prerequisites

While this course is primarily intended for English speakers with prior knowledge of Mandarin, it is designed to be (with the help of supplemental materials listed below) accessible to any student [with time and courage](http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/moser.html){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.35"}.

For a quick introduction to how Indian Buddhist Texts were translated into Chinese, see: {% include inline_content.html category="papers" slug="translation-transcription-and-what-else_funayama-toru" %}

## Textbooks

The course is, as mentioned above, largely a copy-paste of John Kieschnick's excellent (currently six volume!) [_Primer in Chinese Buddhist Writings_](/series/buddhist-chinese-primer_kieschnick).

It proceeds in four parts, corresponding to his three numbered volumes followed by the three supplemental volumes.

### Volume 1: Foundations

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="foundations_kieschnick" %}

The learning objective for this first section is to read (and understand!) an entire Sūtra in Chinese---ideally without having to look at a glossary or dictionary.

#### General Resources for Learning Chinese

This is an extremely challenging but doable goal for someone new to Chinese. If this is you, I recommend the following resources to help learn the basics of the Chinese language:

{% include content_box.html category="reference" slug="trainchinese" %}
{% include content_box.html category="reference" slug="chineseskill" %}
{% include content_box.html category="reference" slug="chinese-grammar_ctcfl" %}

And even for the bilingual English-Chinese speakers, I recommend everyone get:
{% include content_blurb.html category="reference" slug="pleco" %}
- The world's best Chinese dictionaries.
- Note that students of this course may wish to purchase the optional "Flashcards" feature which will allow you to install [this custom dictionary](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gUqbFQHEW0jflx-Srt0fGaPrlu2musMX){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"} containing the vocabulary for the class and review said vocabulary in a flashcard-like interface.
- Make sure to also download the (free) "Buddhist" Dictionary Add-on after you install the app, as it has many Buddhist terms the standard dictionary does not, based on [The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism](http://www.buddhism-dict.net/ddb/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.8"}.

This [Chinese-Sanskrit Dictionary](https://web.archive.org/web/20220301024224if_/https://ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/A%20Buddhist%20Chinese_Sanskrit%20Dict_Hirakawa.pdf){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.8"} may also be helpful for translating Chinese Buddhist texts, keeping in mind that native Chinese and Buddhist Chinese aren't quite the same language:

{% include content_box.html category="articles" slug="buddhist-chinese_zhu-qingzhi" %}

When you've completed volume 1, you should be able to get a good score on the [Chengshilun Hanzi quiz](https://pj-oliveira.github.io/Chengshilun/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"} showing that you're ready to tackle the later Indian texts.

### Volume 2: The Indian Tradition

Once you've successfully completed the sutra in Volume 1, Volume 2 will introduce the three main EBT genres.

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="indian-tradition_kieschnick" %}

Like _Volume 1_, the final goal of this section of the course is also to read some Chinese texts with minimal reference to a dictionary---this time a sūtra, some short abhidharma passages, and a section of the vinaya. As these selections represent the full range of "Hinayana" texts preserved in Chinese translation, a student of early Buddhism has, at this point, finished the course and is ready to be a comparative, textual scholar!

### Volume 3: Texts Composed in China

For those students of Mahayana Buddhism, however, the fun is only just beginning!

{% include content_box.html category="booklets" slug="texts-composed-in-china_kieschnick" %}

Volume 3 (whose structure should, by now, be very familiar!) should be completed first, followed by the Mahāyāna "supplemental" volume and then the Esoteric and Epigraphic volumes if interest and time remain.

## Continuing Study

As we wrap up, I'd like to give a brief shout-out here to [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/){:target="_blank"} and the [Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō Text Database (SAT 2015)](https://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT/satdb2015.php?lang=en){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"}, which host a _very_ large number of canonical Buddhist texts in Chinese---most of which have yet to be translated into English.

祝你一路順利!
