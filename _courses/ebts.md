  - "On the Buddha himself: his life, journey, and character."
  - "In which we get to know the other extraordinary people appearing in the canon."

  - "In this course, we learn about the setting of the EBTs: ancient India at the time of the Buddha and how they understood their own place in the universe."
  - "An introduction to the comparative textual scholarship being done with the EBTs preserved by the Northern Traditions."

## What are the Early Buddhist Texts?

The Early Buddhist Texts are the subset of the canonical literature of the different Buddhist schools which accurately report the teachings of the historical Buddha. These texts have undergone (indeed, continue to undergo) some revision, and contemporary scholarship continues to debate subtle points, but most scholars agree that the Pali Suttas and Chinese Āgamas are historically reliable witnesses to the Buddha's life and direct teachings. Whether they are spiritually reliable, however, is a matter for us to investigate.

## Prerequisites
The [Intro to Buddhism course](/courses/buddhism) is not a prerequisite for this course. Though some familiarity with Buddhism will be helpful, this course is suitable for serious beginners.

### Time Commitment
This course contains about 80 hours of lectures and reading, depending on how fast you read, and can take anywhere from 2 weeks to a year to finish. For example, 3 lectures (6hr) per week would make this a 15 week course.

## The Course
This course gives a thorough introduction to what the Buddha taught in his own words, and also explores how these words came down to us.

### Introduction

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="buddha_true-genius_brahmali" %}
- An introductory lecture by Ajahn Brahmali in which he shares with us his love and enthusiasm for the Buddha’s teachings.
- To listen to the lecture, just click one of the links above!


### Textbook

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="in-the-buddhas-words_bodhi" %}

The main textbook for this course is the (commercial) work **In The Buddha's Words** by Bhikkhu Bodhi. If you cannot obtain a copy of the book, [an open-source version can be read online for free at Reading Faithfully](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/in-the-buddhas-words-an-anthology-of-discourses-from-the-pali-canon-linked-to-suttacentral-net/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.75"}, but the real book is preferred for its helpful redactions and notes.

This book gives a systematic introduction to the Buddha's teachings, and will be the primary text for this class.

### About the Texts

As you make your way through ItBW, I encourage you to weave in the following works about 
the history of the texts you're studying:

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="itbw_general-intro_bodhi" blurb="
- Gives a good overview of the oral tradition. Be sure not to skip it!" %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="buddha-as-a-teacher_dhammika" %}
- In what context and in what way were these teachings delivered? And to what purpose?

{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="vaca_analayo" %}
- How did the Buddha speak?

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_texts_sujato-and-brahmali" blurb="
- We invite Ajahn Brahmali back, along with our friend (and founder of SuttaCentral) Ajahn Sujato, for a special guest class on the early texts." %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="early-buddhism-with-kalupahana_payne" blurb="
- On why it's important to study the early texts." %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="in-search-of-the-real-buddha_harvey" blurb="
- About the Buddha of the Early Texts compared with the later hagiographies… and our own materialistic assumptions." %}

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="oral-transmission_wynne" %}
- Argues against an improvisational oral transmission and shows why we should think of the texts as having been passed down to us (relatively) verbatim

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="footprints-in-the-dust_dhammika" %}
- A down-to-earth biography of the Buddha based on the Pāḷi texts.

### Lectures

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="in-the-buddhas-words_bodhi" %}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi himself will be your lecturer for this class.

Read a chapter of *In the Buddha's Words* (hereafter abbreviated as ItBW), and then
listen to the lecture associated with that chapter before moving on to the next.
Starting with chapter six, however, the content starts to get a bit more challenging
and Bhikkhu Bodhi's lectures start to slow down. You may want to adjust your reading
pace accordingly at that point.

Some of Bhikkhu Bodhi's handouts for the course can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gzcv--ssI1eu53T5dTxKtL1y-BQlGTgT).

### Office Hours

If any questions come up for you that aren't addressed in the lectures, I recommend 
[searching the SuttaCentral Discourse Forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/search) 
for something relevant to your question. If you can't find your question answered in 
the archives, feel free to post it! There are many knowledgeable scholars and students 
of Early Buddhism on the forum (including yours truly) and we would be happy to help!

### One Additional Sutra

In addition to the Pāli texts highlighted in ItBW, I recommend the following additional discourse:

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="ma220" %}
- This discourse from the Chinese Canon is included to demonstrate how extraordinarily similar the language of the northern Agamas are compared to the language of the Pāli Canon (preserved in Sri Lanka)
This sutra is most directly parallel to the Pāli texts presented in ItBW chapter nine on the Five Aggregates, and it could be read when you get to that part of the book, or after you've finished.

## Conclusion

We end the course with this word of advice:
