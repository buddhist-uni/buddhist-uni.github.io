  - "A deeper dive into the theory and practice of Buddhism."
  - "If you've enjoyed studying the suttas with Bhikkhu Bodhi, this course is a natural continuation. We'll continue our methodical study of the suttas and their historicity by going thematically through half of the Middle Length Discourses. A very long course, suitable for casual study over a period of years, by the end of it you'll have an excellent foundation in Early Buddhism."
  - "If you would like to develop a more independant reading of the Canon, this course deepens our text-critical study of the Pali with some fun and accessible sutta and vinaya material."
  - "On the Buddha himself: his life, journey, and character."
  - "In which we get to know the other extraordinary people appearing in the canon."
  - "We explore the metaphors, words, and similes of the Early Buddhist Texts and begin to read the language of the suttas more closely in this highly recommended class."
  - "In this course, we learn about the setting of the EBTs: ancient India at the time of the Buddha and how they understood their own place in the universe."
  - "A deeper dive into comparative textual scholarship being done with the EBTs preserved in the Northern Traditions."

## What are the Early Buddhist Texts?

The Early Buddhist Texts are the subset of the canonical literature of the different Buddhist schools which modern scholarship suggests accurately report the teachings of the historical Buddha. These texts have undergone (indeed, continue to undergo) some revision and redaction, and contemporary scholarship continues to debate many points, however a broad consensus has emerged that most of the Pali Suttas and Chinese Āgamas are historically reliable. Whether they are spiritually reliable, however, is a matter for us to investigate.


## Prerequisites
The [Intro to Buddhism course]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}) is not a prerequisite for this course. Though some familiarity with Buddhism will be helpful, this course is suitable for serious beginners.

### Time Commitment
This course takes about 80 hours to complete, depending on how long it takes you to read and contemplate the suttas. As such, the course can take anywhere from 2 weeks to a year to finish. For example, 3 lectures (6hr) per week would make this a 15 week course.

## Course Outline
This course gives a thorough introduction to what the Buddha taught in his own words, and also explores how these words came down to us.

### Introduction

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="buddha_true-genius_brahmali" %}
- An introductory lecture by Ajahn Brahmali in which he shares with us his love and enthusiasm for the Buddha’s teachings.


### Textbook

{% include inline_content.html category="monographs" slug="in-the-buddhas-words_bodhi" %}

The main textbook for this course is the (commercial) work **In The Buddha's Words** by Bhikkhu Bodhi. If you cannot obtain a copy of the book, [an open-source version can be read online for free at Reading Faithfully](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/in-the-buddhas-words-an-anthology-of-discourses-from-the-pali-canon-linked-to-suttacentral-net/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.75"}, but the real book is preferred for its helpful redactions and notes.

This book gives a systematic introduction to the Buddha's teachings, and will be the primary text for this class.

### Lectures

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="in-the-buddhas-words_bodhi" %}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi himself will be your lecturer for this class.

Read a chapter of *In the Buddha's Words* (hereafter abbreviated as ItBW), and then
listen to the lecture associated with that chapter before moving on to the next.
Starting with chapter six, however, the content starts to get a bit more challenging
and Bhikkhu Bodhi's lectures start to slow down. You may want to adjust your reading
pace accordingly at that point.

### Office Hours

If any questions come up for you that aren't addressed in the lectures, I recommend 
[searching the SuttaCentral Discourse Forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/search) 
for something relevant to your question. If you can't find your question answered in 
the archives, feel free to post it! There are many knowledgeable scholars and students 
of Early Buddhism on the forum (including yours truly) and we would be happy to help!

### About the Texts

As you make your way through ItBW, I encourage you to weave in the following works about 
the history of the texts you're studying:

{% include inline_content.html category="excerpts" slug="itbw_general-intro_bodhi" %}
- Gives a good overview of the oral tradition. Don't skip it! 

{% include inline_content.html category="articles" slug="early-buddhism-with-kalupahana_payne" %}
- On why it's important to study the early texts.
- Read alongside chapter one of ItBW

{% include inline_content.html category="articles" slug="in-search-of-the-real-buddha_harvey" %}
- About the Buddha of the Early Texts compared with the later hagiographies… and our own materialistic assumptions.
- This should be read alongside chapter two of ItBW which is about the Buddha

{% include inline_content.html category="papers" slug="birch-bark-to-digital-data_introduction_harrison-and-hartmann" %}
- Gives an overview of the archeology and methodology employed by modern scholars.
- Don't read this to memorize the details. It won't be on the test! Mostly it's presented here to give a “behind the scenes” peek at the scholarship that's gone into discovering early Buddhism.
- Read alongside chapter three of ItBW: Approaching the Dhamma

{% include inline_content.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_texts_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- We invite Ajahn Brahmali back, along with our friend (and founder of SuttaCentral) Ajahn Sujato, for a special guest class on the early texts.
- Should be done alongside chapter five of ItBW

{% include inline_content.html category="articles" slug="historical-authenticity_wynne" %}
- Gives a short overview of how we know these texts are in fact authentic
- Alongside chapter seven of ItBW

{% include inline_content.html category="articles" slug="oral-transmission_wynne" %}
- Argues against an improvisational oral transmission and shows why we should think of the texts as having been recited verbatim
- Read alongside chapter nine of ItBW (where the “verbatim” character of some of the suttas should become readily apparent!) 

### One Additional Sutra

In addition to the Pāli texts highlighted in ItBW, I recommend the following additional discourse:

{% include inline_content.html category="canon" slug="ma220" %}
- This discourse from the Chinese Canon is included to demonstrate how extraordinarily similar the language of the northern Agamas are compared to the language of the Pāli Canon (preserved in Sri Lanka)
This sutra is most directly parallel to the Pāli texts presented in ItBW chapter nine on the Five Aggregates and it could be read when you get to that part of the book, or after you've finished.

## Conclusion

We end the course with this word of advice:
