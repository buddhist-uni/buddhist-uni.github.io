## What is the Stilling of the Mind?

The core of dependent origination is the reciprocal relationship between consciousness and name-and-form. We believe we exist because we feel we exist, and we feel we exist because we believe we do.

Unraveling this self-perpetuating feedback loop requires significant effort to cut through our conceptual layers to see the reality of our experience unfiltered by ignorance. When ignorance is broken through, the activity of name-and-form completely stops and consciousness is unconditioned. This, just this, is the cessation of suffering.

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced course which assumes considerable prior engagement with [the Pali Suttas](/tags/sutta) and [Buddhist Philosophy](/courses/philosophy) (in particular [Dependent Origination](/tags/origination) and [Buddhist Psychology](/tags/thought)).

## Textbook

This course is based on Bhikkhu Ñāṇananda's sermons:

## Lectures

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="nibbana-lectures_analayo" %}
- Bhikkhu Anālayo reads the above lectures, adding his own insightful reflections and providing alternative translations for some of the suttas quoted.
- If you prefer to watch the lectures on YouTube, they can be found [in this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYtsCwnwtnPR4pzo5lGzsaftlhqpc7C4T){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="2"}

## Course Instructions

[The course](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rv4uxnZX4Hnhjpm_2AP3CEVKWRaV51iR/view?usp=sharing) proceeds linearly through the lectures (no surprise). You can read along with Bhante's lectures either in the original book, or in [his lecture notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qxaEtE7G6ZQ85W7Ghfy54oEueR3CnIMN){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="2"} which contain the alternative translations mentioned.

Of course, meditation and reflection "outside of class" is encouraged. As ever, if you have any questions, feel free to post on [DhammaWheel](https://www.dhammawheel.com/viewforum.php?f=13&sid=f7aa6f1d326313d8ef96bc802fb6ae02){:target="_blank"} or [SuttaCentral](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/bhikkhu-analayos-e-learning-course-on-the-nibbana-sermons-by-bhikkhu-katukurunde-na-ananda/3321/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.6"}.

This course is a real treat. I hope you enjoy it!
