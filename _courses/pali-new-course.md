## What is the Pāli Language?

Pāli is the liturgical language of Theravāda Buddhism. An ancient, colloquial relative of Sanskrit, Pāli benefits from a number of ambiguities and variations. A testament to Pāli's long history, such irregularities can make Pāli tricky to decipher, but (thankfully) did little to corrupt the Pāli Canon as a record of the Buddha's teachings.  While the Pāli Canon is unlikely to be the verbatim words of the Buddha, studying the Pāli Language is still as close as we can get to hearing his original voice.

## Course Information

This course is an introduction to reading the Pāli Canon in its original language.

### Prerequisites

Though you need not have taken [the "Level 1" Primer Course](/courses/pali-primer) to take this class, some prior knowledge of Pāli or Sanskrit is required. This course also assumes prior comfort with [the doctrinal content of the Canon](/courses/ebts) as it focuses more on language acquisition than philosophical engagement.

### Time Requirement

There are approximately 40 hours of lectures (depending on which section you take) and approximately as much homework.

### Textbook

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="new-course-in-reading-pali_gair-karunatillake" %}

### Lectures

This course is taught, once again, by Bhikkhu Bodhi, but this time in two sections.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="second-pali-course_bodhi" %}
- This version of the course was taught in 53 lectures to students who had just completed [his "Primer" course](/courses/pali-primer).
- If you are taking this "Level 2" course having just completed the "Level 1" course, this is likely the set of lectures you'll want to take as it picks up exactly where the previous course left off.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="new-pali-course_bodhi" %}
- This version of the class was taught in 34 lectures to a new group of students.
- If you're coming to this course having not taken "Level 1" but with prior knowledge of Pāli or Sanskrit from elsewhere, this set of lectures is for you.

### Homework

Note that significant homework will be assigned in this class. As the homework is the bulk of the learning for the course, please be sure to do it.

Note that there were also [a number of handouts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k8en0xS2pDZ9Bv-UKGHYcfU0qLsAG5Js){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"} and [tables](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DuL_xGYaHzwxSbZc-Agun1MkVV7GHOTs){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"} distributed during the class that may be helpful to review.

### Office Hours

If any questions come up for you that aren't addressed in the lectures, I recommend posting to
[the SuttaCentral Discourse Forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/){:target="_blank"} where a community
of helpful Pāli scholars will be sure to help!
