# Readings

{% include content_blurb.html category="canon" slug="sn45.8" blurb="
Here is the Canonical definition of the Noble Eightfold Path from the Buddha himself.
Now that we've covered (most) of the Path in some depth, this should be (mostly) review.

I encourage you to keep this sutta open while listening to the lecture so you can follow along and anchor your understanding in the text.
" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="noble-eightfold-path_bodhi" blurb='
We return to mindfulness now after having thoroughly covered the previous steps of the Noble Eightfold Path.
As you read, reflect on how your understanding of "mindfulness" has changed (if at all) since [our second module](/courses/buddhism/mindfulness).

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="biography-of-shakyamuni_hsing-yun" blurb="
We continue with Chapters 37‚Äì38 of the Buddha's story.

## Further Reading

·π¨hƒÅnissaro Bhikkhu's books are some of the most methodical explanations of the Buddhist path around.
If you prefer a more philosophical work, I recommend starting with his book [**Noble Strategy**](/content/booklets/noble-strategy_geoff)
and if you prefer a lighter tone, I recommend jumping right into his dhamma talks with the book [**Meditations 4**](/content/booklets/meditations-4_geoff).

All of ·π¨hƒÅnissaro Bhikkhu's books and talks can be found on his website, [DhammaTalks.org](https://www.dhammatalks.org/){:target="_blank"}
