The compassionate wisdom and peerless example of the Buddha show us the way out of Saṃsāra.

## Readings

I'd like to introduce you now to the other four texts (in addition to [_Being Nobody, Going Nowhere_](/content/monographs/being-nobody-going-nowhere_khema)) that we'll be reading through the remainder of this course:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="what-the-buddha-taught_rahula-w" blurb="
This classic introduction to Buddhism has had a dramatic impact on the shape of Buddhist thought in the West, but its interest is not merely historical: it remains a  lucid and sympathetic introduction, accessible to modern readers even today, more than fifty years later. 
" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="biography-of-shakyamuni_hsing-yun" blurb="
A deeply human, simple but powerful retelling of the Buddha’s life story from a renowned modern master.
An excellent biography of the Buddha.
" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="noble-eightfold-path_bodhi" blurb="
A precise yet readable overview of the Buddhist Path by one of the greatest scholars of Pāḷi Buddhism alive today.
" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="fundamentals_santina-peter" blurb="
A transcribed lecture series from the 1980s introducing Buddhism to a Western-educated audience.
" %}

We’ll break these up into bite-sized pieces over the coming lessons.

For this module, let's **begin by reading:**
- Chapters 1–3 of *The Biography* on the ancient Indian context into which the Buddha was born (Don't worry: they're short chapters!)
- Chapter 1 of *What the Buddha Taught*
- And (optionally) through Chapter 2 of *Fundamentals* if you'd like to learn a bit about ancient India
- (We'll come back to Bhikkhu Bodhi's *Path* in [Module 7](/courses/buddhism/the-path) and will return to _Being Nobody_ in the next lesson.)

**In addition** to cracking open our new books, see:

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="triumph-over-mara" blurb="
This short video introduces the symbolism of a common Buddha statue.
" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="excerpts" slug="prayer-and-worship_malalasekera" blurb='
Contemporary Buddhists do indeed worship the Buddha, but what do they think about when they bow to the Buddha statue? Is it "prayer" when Buddhists chant?

## Lecture
When you're finished with the above (I'll wait!), I'd like to introduce you to our main lecturer for this course: Bhikkhu Bodhi. 

Bhikkhu Bodhi is an American monk trained in Sri Lanka, most famous for publishing excellent translations of the Buddha's words into English. He will teach all the odd-numbered lessons for the remainder of this course. (The even-numbered lectures will feature an array of guest speakers.)

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="triple-gem_bodhi" blurb="
In this first lecture, Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces himself and the class and gives a more standard introduction to the Triple Gem than we got in our first lecture.

## Further Reading
If you enjoyed Bhikkhu Bodhi's lecture, I  recommend reading [his booklet **_The Buddha and his Dhamma_**](/content/booklets/buddha-and-his-dhamma_bodhi) now (or later) for a deeper introduction.
And for more about what refuge means to a Buddhist, see the excellent treatise: [**_Refuge_** by Thanissaro Bhikkhu](https://www.dhammatalks.org/ebook_index.html#refuge){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="3"}
