This lesson, we introduce our first "sutta" (or, "Discourse") from the Pāḷi Canon — the "Bible" for Theravāda Buddhists. There are thousands of such "Discourses" in the Canon, and each represents one occasion in the Buddhaʼs long, teaching career. 

This particularly poetic discourse is roughly the Buddhist equivalent of the passage on love in the Christian Bible: [1 Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=NIV){:target="_blank"}. 

Notice, though, how the Buddhaʼs description of love explicitly extends our compassionate circle of concern to **all** sentient beings.

Also, rather than framing the sermon as a description of what love is (“patient, kind” etc), notice how the Buddha instead describes love as a practice, giving us instructions on what “should be done.” This shift away from descriptive philosophy and towards ethical praxis is one of the hallmarks of Buddhism, especially in contrast to Western philosophy.

Consider reading this sutta out loud too, remembering that the Buddhaʼs words were originally passed down by oral recitation.

## Lecture

For today's guest, I'd like to introduce you to Ajahn Brahm. Ajahn Brahm was a British physicist who was ordained in Thailand and now heads a monastery in Australia, among several other teaching engagements. He's a widely published author and one of the most highly respected, Western monks alive today.
