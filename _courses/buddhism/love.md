This lesson, we introduce our first "sutta" (or, "Discourse") from the PƒÅ·∏∑i Canon. The PƒÅ·∏∑i Canon is kind of like the Bible for Theravada Buddhists. There are thousands of such "Discourses" in the Canon, and each represents one occasion in the Buddha ºs long career. 

This particularly poetic discourse is roughly the Buddhist equivalent of the passage on love in the Christian Bible: [1 Corinthians 13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13&version=NIV){:target="_blank"}. 

Notice, though, how the Buddha ºs description of love explicitly extends our compassionate circle of concern to **all** sentient beings.

Also, rather than framing the sermon as a description of what love is (‚Äúpatient, kind‚Äù etc), notice how the Buddha instead describes love as a practice, giving us instructions on what ‚Äúshould be done.‚Äù This shift away from descriptive philosophy and towards ethical praxis is one of the hallmarks of Buddhism, especially in contrast to Western philosophy.

Consider reading this sutta out loud too, remembering that the Buddha ºs words were originally passed down by oral recitation.
