Are you excited? Nervous?

Well, I'm excited too! But there's no need to be nervous.

1. There are **no grades** at OBU
2. And all our assignments are optional.

As an [Open Access](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access/open-education) institution, we believe in **student-driven learning** and work to empower *you*.

## Office Hours

If you would like to get in touch with the instructor, please feel free to [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
You can connect with other students of Early Buddhism at [the SuttaCentral Forum](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/frequently-asked-questions-faq/24?u=khemarato.bhikkhu){:target="_blank" ._}

## Course Structure

This course will proceed in **14 modules**.

Each module is a self-contained unit and contains assigned readings together with a lecture and some reflection questions.  It's recommended that you do the modules **in order**, doing **about two modules per week** as your schedule permits.

Since this course will take at least a few weeks to complete, please take a moment now to bookmark this document. Perhaps share the link with a friend so you can find it later!
