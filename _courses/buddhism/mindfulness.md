Mindfulness is perhaps Buddhism's most distinctive and important "psycho-technology."
It is, succinctly, the ability to attend: to direct attention to the present reality and to recognize where we are and what we are doing.
When we bring the mind back to the present moment and experience it fully, we live each moment and are able to remember every detail of our experience later.
Directing attention also gives us the ability to regulate our emotions, as emotions are simply a product of what we attend to.

## Reading Assignments

Before each lecture, at the top of each module, I will assign a few reading assignments to prepare you for the next lecture and to provide some food for thought.

This lesson we'll read a short booklet and a popular article on meditation, and read a couple chapters from what will be our main textbook for the class:

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="miracle-of-mindfulness_tnh" %}
{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="meditation-moral-obligation_vox" blurb='
An overview of the benefits of meditation, this article asks about moral "obligation" whereas Buddhism talks about "karma" which we can think about as "opportunities" versus Western "duties." How does reframing morality as an opportunity help you understand the question at the heart of this article?

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="being-nobody-going-nowhere_khema" blurb="
This classic introduction to Buddhism begins with meditation and widens out to the Buddhist view on life.
This lesson, let's **start by reading chapter one and chapter five**. Chapter 5 is a guided meditation on Loving-Kindness. Read it slowly and try to cultivate the mind-states mentioned in the text.
