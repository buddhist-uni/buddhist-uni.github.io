## Assigned Readings

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="biography-of-shakyamuni_hsing-yun" blurb="
We continue with Chapters 32–36, on how the Buddha's community grew under his leadership.

<details><summary>A note on the myth of the first nuns</summary>
While all the Buddhist traditions have a similar myth to chapter 32 about the first nuns,
the earliest Buddhist texts actually report that the Buddha was eager to establish a nun’s community
<a target='_blank' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato?lang=en&layout=linebyline&reference=main&notes=sidenotes&highlight=false&script=latin#3.8.3'>from the very beginning</a>.
<br />
This and the numerous inconsistencies in the story
(such as that the Buddha nowhere else refuses someone three times and then later changes his mind)
has led many modern scholars to suggest that this myth arose in the centuries
after the Buddha but before Buddhism split into different schools.
