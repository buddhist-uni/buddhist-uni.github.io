title: "Study Time"

This month we've added three new sections to the library on
[Karma](/tags/karma), [Dialogue](/tags/dialogue), and [Time](/tags/time).

## Karma

The Buddha's "Law of Karma" is simple in its basic formulation:

> It is impossible, it never happens, that a wished-for, desired and agreeable result should come of bad conduct [...]
> It is impossible, it never happens, that an unwished-for, undesired and disagreeable result should come of good conduct
~ [MN 115](https://suttacentral.net/mn115/en/nyanamoli-thera?lang=en&reference=main&highlight=false#nya28)

In this basic "law," the Buddha guarenteed the moral _directionality_ of karma.

He then has us reflect often that:

> Kamma·ssak·omhi, [I own my actions]  
Kamma·dāyādo.. [I am the heir to my actions]
~ [AN 10.48](https://www.buddha-vacana.org/formulae/kamma.html)

But working out the precise details of karma is "unthinkably" complex:

> anyone who tries to conjecture about the results of deeds will go mad or get frustrated.
~ [AN 4.77](https://suttacentral.net/an4.77/en/sujato?lang=en)

Hopefully the free books, talks, articles and suttas we've put together
in [our new bibliography on karma](/tags/karma) help to make some sense of this
"imponderable" philosophy without driving anyone mad!

For example,
[this article](/content/articles/transformation-of-inherited-indo-european-phraseology_olav-hackstein)
traces the wider cultural resonances and nuances of the Pāli word "dāyādo" (see above)
giving us a more nuanced appreciation of the imagery behind that common chant.

## Buddhist Philosophy in Dialogue

Over the ages, Buddhists have discussed many such subtle points of their doctrine as this with each other.
These discussions form one way of viewing the arc of Buddhist history.

For that story of Buddhism, you could certainly do worse than reading
[Kalupahana's "History of Buddhist Philosophy"](https://archive.org/details/historyofbuddhistphilosophycontinuitiesanddiscontinuitiesdavidkalupahanaj._915_e/page/n7/mode/1up)
which strikes a refreshing balance between the early and later Buddhist perspectives, giving an excellent overview of its titular subject.

And in the rest of our bibliography on Buddhist dialogue,
I'm pleased to present you with a variety of other instructive and interesting debates in Buddhist philosophy
which continue to shape the religion today.
[Click here](/tags/dialogue) to check those out!

## Time

And for the larger arc of _human_ history, I'm pleased to share with you [a new bibliography on "Time"](/tags/time).

There you will find a mix of [books about history](/content/monographs/making-sense-of-world-history_szostak-rick)
along with works on the [philosophy](/content/essays/time-being_dogen)
and even [scientific research](/content/articles/day-dinos-died_preston-douglas) of time,
such as [this fascinating paper demonstrating why people have always felt like the world is getting worse](/content/articles/illusion-of-moral-decline_mastroianni-adam-et-al).

Whichever way the world goes, however, I hope that we can continue to progress in the Dhamma together.
Thank you for your continued support of The Open Buddhist University and until next "time":
