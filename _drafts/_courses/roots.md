## Overview

This course is about the history of Buddhism

---

TODO(roots)

---

## Prerequisites
This course assumes familiarity with [the fundamentals of Buddhism]({% link _courses/buddhism.md %}), but no worries if you're rusty: you'll get a refresher [below](#i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron).


## The Course
This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. 

The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism. The second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community, and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices.

### Introduction
On forms and the formless.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="on-science-religion-and-culture_yuttadhammo" %}
- Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism.


{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="what-buddhism-offers_yuttadhammo" %}
- Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism.

### Sourcebook

Throughout this course, we'll be using a **Common Buddhist Text** as our primary source:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="common-buddhist-text" %}
- An anthology from the canons of the Three Vehicles, giving us a taste of the canonical literature from the various traditions.

Selections will be referenced like this:

- [CBT] L.59
  - For example, this refers to the passage in *Common Buddhist Text* about Ven Vaṅgīsa which contains a poem in praise of the Buddha. 
  - To look up the passage, search the PDF or skim the Table of Contents for the reference number ("L.59").

This passage, for example, is on page 84 of the above pdf (note: page numbers differ in the printed editions).


### Part 1: The Sociology and History of Buddhism
#### Textbooks

There are two textbooks for this first part of the course:

{% include content_blurb.html category="monographs" slug="buddhist-religion_robinson-et-al" %}
- The main textbook for this part, *Robinson* will give us an accessible and enjoyable survey of Buddhism’s long history across Asia and beyond.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-sociological-thought_gnanarama" %}
- A more theoretical text, *Gnanarama* will provide an introduction to how Buddhists  themselves thought about the sociology of religion.
- Feel free to skip the readings from this book if you're not as interested in theory.


#### Introduction

Let us start off by reading Chapter 1 (“Towards a Definition”) of _Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought_ to round off our discussion of how Buddhism can be defined as a “religion” and how it may relate to other concepts you've heard of.

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="i-wonder-why_thubten-chodron" %}
- For a refresher on the basics of Buddhism, I recommend skimming this Q&A with Thubten Chodron before we dive into the more detailed history below.
- There's no need to read it thoroughly: just read the answers to whatever questions interest you.

#### Supplementary Material to *Robinson*

As you read through Robinson et al's _Historical Introduction_ one chapter at a time, please also consider:

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 1: Awakening

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="buddha-you-never-knew_dhammika" %}
- The Buddha was a real, historical figure, but many of the stories about his life are myths still expanding today.

[CBT] L.7–17
{:.mb-0}
- Here we get the Buddha's spiritual journey in his own words.
- Notice the repetitive nature of the early, oral texts.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 2: Dhamma, Medicine and Sociology
{:.mb-0}
- This chapter introduces us to the central metaphor of Buddhism as a medical science, and the social implications of that framing.

##### Parallel to Robinson Ch 2: Teacher

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhism_history_sujato-and-brahmali" %}
- An Introduction to Buddhist History

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="stupas-of-shwedagon_u-win-maung" %}
- “Stupas” are mentioned as sites of worship even in the earliest texts and archeology as the burial sites of great leaders. This paper shows what those looked like, from ancient India to modern Burma.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="symbolism-of-the-early-stupa_harvey" %}
- They're beautiful, aren't they? But what do they mean?

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="buddhist-wheel-symbol_karunaratne" %}
- While the Christians have the <i class="fas fa-cross"></i> cross and the Jews the <i class="fas fa-star-of-david"></i> star, the Buddhists have the <i class="fas fa-dharmachakra"></i> wheel as the symbol of their religion. But where did this wheel come from and what does it mean?

[CBT] Th.13, L.25, Th.205, L.23, L.30, L.34, L.39, L.42, L.53, L.57, Th.28, Th.59, Th.73–75, Th.98, Th.116, Th.171
{:.mb-0}
- Here we get a few stories about the Buddha's life as a teacher from the early texts.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought)</i> Chapter 3: Significance of Buddhist Chanting
{:.mb-0}
- Even in the Buddha’s time, monks would recite the teachings verbatim to acclimate to them and keep them in mind. Over time, this chanting became seen as apotropaic and was therefore ritualized quite early on. Today, chanting features prominently across Buddhist traditions and practices.

##### Parallel to Robinson chapter 3: “Development”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="assertion-and-restraint_dixon-graham" %}
- Buddhism is not an especially evangelical religion. This paper explores the unique (compared to other religions) way that Buddhism spread.

{% include content_blurb.html category="papers" slug="venerated-objects-early-buddhism_harvey" %}
- The early Buddhists of ancient India did not represent the Buddha with anthropomorphic statues as is ubiquitous now. This essay explores the symbols and objects that were venerated in the early period after the Buddha’s death.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="lotus-as-symbol_olson_carl" %}
- One such object which became notably ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures is the lotus flower.  This article explores the ancient origins and meaning of this potent symbol.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="offering-flowers_dodrupchen" %}
- And this essay commends the virtues of offering flowers: a lovely practice still common across Buddhist Asia

[CBT] M.5, Th.94
{:.mb-0}

[CBT] Th.157
{:.mb-0}
- This verse was especially popular to carve on early monuments to the Buddha.

[CBT] Th.217
{:.mb-0}
- An account of the first council of the Buddha's disciples after his death, at which the teachings were first codified.

- In praise of the Sutras, preserved after the Buddha's death.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="early-buddhist-oral-tradition_analayo" %}
- How were these texts preserved? How reliable are they, and how should we think about the study of Buddhist history?

[CBT] M.36, M.38
{:.mb-0}
- On the practice of giving to the Sangha in order to transfer merit to one’s deceased relatives: a practice that became common in the years after the Buddha.

[CBT] M.96
{:.mb-0}
- On the practice of releasing animals for merit, a tradition now found across the Buddhist world.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 5 (we'll come back to 4 later): Buddhist Art Symbols For Religious Edification
{:.mb-0}
- Art, offerings and other public devotions provided early (and current)  Buddhists with an effective, yet soft, way to spread the religion.

##### Chapter 4: “The Rise of Mahayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="second-buddha_loy" %}
- Nagarjuna criticized the excessive developments of Buddhism in the centuries after the Buddha and reestablished emptiness as the central tenant of Buddhism, laying the philosophical groundwork for the Mahayana.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="arahants-bodhisattvas-and-buddhas_bodhi" %}
- In this essay, Bhikkhu Bodhi explores the Bodhisattva ideal from the perspective of the Theravāda and Mahayana.

[CBT] Th.210
{:.mb-0}
- The description of reality as perceived by an awakened being in the early texts became the basis for much speculation about the nature of reality after the Buddha's passing

[CBT] M.143, M.16, M.111–112 (note: M.112 is mislabeled "M.114")
{:.mb-0}
- Nirvana came to be identified as being the same as ultimate reality, and as the essential nature of the mind.

[CBT] M.44, M.61, M.103, M.137
{:.mb-0}
- "Emptiness"—also present in early Buddhism—was deployed to counter this essentializing tendency.

[CBT] M.62, M.142
{:.mb-0}
- This eventually led to a "Middle Way" synthesis of these philosophical extremes.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 4 (as promised): Aesthetics
{:.mb-0}
- Aesthetics was actually a major point of departure for the Early Mahayana, who rejected the cold austerity of the Abhidhamma in favor of more beautiful expressions of enlightened wisdom.

##### Chapter 5: “The Pantheon”

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="karma-vibanga-reliefs-at-borobudur_anandajoti" %}
- In the centuries after the Buddha, many of the subtleties of karma were simplified for didactic expedience. This led to a formulaic, "if you do this, this will happen to you" understanding of karma (which the Buddha himself rejected as fatalistic) that came to be repeated ad-infinitum in texts (such as the Karma-Vibanga) and in Buddhist art (such as, here, at Borobudur) for millennia, perpetuating a (mis)understanding of Karma which has persisted to today.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="abduction-of-queen-kakati_patrick-kit" %}
- But, as Buddhism became more popular and spread around and out of India, it also picked up an artistic and mythological richness that textured and enlivened the tradition. Indeed, Buddhism’s ability to embrace and contextualize local mythology has long been a key to its ability to spread peacefully.
- The story behind [this ancient, Buddhist statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gandhara,_garuda_adduce_la_regina_kakati,_periodo_kushan_200-400.JPG){:target="_blank"}.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="narratives-of-buddhist-relics-and-images_berkwitz-s" %}
- Such foreign converts often yearned for a solid connection back to the Buddha. One common expression of this was the creation and authentication of local "souvenirs" which also play a prominent role in popular Buddhism to this day.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="true-dhamma-has-disappeared_geoff" %}
- In addition to new relics and stories explaining them, many new teachings were also introduced. Today, as all the remaining traditions have picked up their fair share of shady teachers, deity cults, and doctrinal confusion, Ajahn Geoff reminds us that we have to be discerning about where we place our faith.

<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> <i>Aspects</i> Chapter 6: Socialization for Death
{:.mb-0}
- What effect does Buddhism's encouragement to reflect on death and impermanence have on how Buddhists perceive the cosmos, life, and the religion itself?

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="pure-land_bloom" %}
- All these factors—increased deification, a concern over death and the decline of the sasana, etc—fueled the movement towards what we now call "Pure Land" Buddhism: a next-life focused practice still very popular in East Asia today.

[CBT] M.73, V.33, M.56–57, M.49, M.91, M.67, M.99
{:.mb-0}
- Practitioners came to be encouraged to aspire to Buddhahood themselves and to take the Bodhisattva Path rather than to take the "lesser" path of the disciple so as to maximize the benefit that their enlightenment can have for others.

[CBT] M.68
{:.mb-0}
- Role models, guides, and supporters are crucial for this Bodhisattva Path.

[CBT] M.55
{:.mb-0}
- Thankfully, there are advanced Bodhisattvas living now as gods who can be called upon to support you on your journey.

[CBT] M.144, M.6
{:.mb-0}
- Even the Buddha himself came to be immortalized as a quasi-god.

[CBT] M.107, M.154
{:.mb-0}
- If the Buddha isn't truly gone, then that means all the Buddhas of the past are also still out there, making them nearly indistinguishable from the advanced, heavenly Bodhisattvas.

[CBT] M.158
{:.mb-0}
- We can even aspire to be reborn in one of those "Buddha fields" where a Buddha is currently teaching, which promises a fast track to enlightenment.

[CBT] M.129
{:.mb-0}
- This all eventually came to mirror Hinduism so closely that this sutra directly equates the Buddha with Brahma and the Buddhists with the Brahmins. 

##### After Chapter 6 of Robinson on “Vajrayana”

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="mudras_tricycle" %}
- Taking an important role during the later development of Buddhist art and esoterica, mudras such as the “Anjali” of respect are now ubiquitous in the Buddhist cultural sphere, and are nearly synonymous with Buddhism itself.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="central-asian_kudara" %}
- While largely not Buddhist today, the deserts of Central Asia were key to the medieval spread of Buddhism.

{% include content_blurb.html category="articles" slug="story-of-the-horse-king_appleton" %}
- One story, five countries.
- Shows how each nation where Buddhism spread adapted the Indic mythology to explain their own local conditions, and gives us a fascinating window into the spread of Buddhism across Asia.

{% include content_blurb.html category="reference" slug="electronic-atlas-of-monasteries_ciolek" blurb="Take a second to appreciate the explosive spread of Buddhism across Asia shown in these maps of medieval monasteries." %}

[CBT] Th.208
{:.mb-0}
- The early textual basis for equating enlightenment with a "diamond-like" mind.

[CBT] M.11, M.17, V.3, M.22, M.42, V.23, V.30, V.38, V.43, M.106, M.114, M.147–149
{:.mb-0}

- See also, [CBT] Th.17–20

##### Parallel to Robinson's Regional Chapters 

As we transition to more contemporary forms of Buddhism, let us set aside *Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought* for now, and consider the contemporary, lived traditions.
While not representative of the diversity within each of the following "national" forms, I hope that the texts and clips below capture something of their beauty.

##### Robinson Chapter 7: Sri Lanka

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bojjhanga-suttas_dhammaruwan" %}
- First, we have this extraordinary recording of a boy in Sri Lanka spontaneously remembering how he chanted Pāli in a past life.

[CBT] Th.90–91, Th.146, Th.159
{:.mb-0}
- The Theravāda philosophical tradition loves to break Dharmas into exact parts and definitions.

[CBT] Th.135, Th.152, Th.145
{:.mb-0}
- The Theravāda is also famous for its "morbid" meditations on pain and death.

[CBT] Th.52, Th.108
{:.mb-0}
- But Theravāda isn't all bleak, as they also celebrate the beauty of the Dhamma and of good companionship.

[CBT] Th.194
{:.mb-0}
- Very conservative in their practice of the monastic rules, Theravāda monks still go on alms round and abstain from eating dinner to this day.

[CBT] Th.117, Th.172, Th.181, Th.196, Th.226
{:.mb-0}
- Lastly, we read Theravāda responses to some Mahayana ideas.


##### Robinson Chapter 8: China

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="drums-and-bells_qing-de" %}
- A monk at a lonely temple, deep in the mountains of Taiwan, says goodbye to the day with drum and bell.

[CBT] Th.41, M.115
{:.mb-0}
- The Confucian social values of ancient China found a natural counterpart in certain early Buddhist teachings, which came to be emphasized.

[CBT] Th.50, M.34
{:.mb-0}
- Here, for example, we compare the earlier (Theravāda) perspective on honoring one's parents with the Chinese perspective.

[CBT] M85–86
{:.mb-0}
- Yet there were some real innovations, such as the Chinese Buddhist embrace of vegetarianism.

[CBT] Th.218, M.14
{:.mb-0}
- Notice here how sutras and scholarship themselves came to be objects of worship.

[CBT] M.165
{:.mb-0}
- The Chan/Zen school, however, rejected this new focus on texts, and claimed an authority based on a transmission "outside" the Sutras.

[CBT] M.80
{:.mb-0}
- They advocated a wise, flexible ethics not slavishly devoted to following monastic rules.

[CBT] M.127
{:.mb-0}
- And a "direct, non-conceptual" experience of the truth,opposed to the mere "verbal" Dharma of the sutras.

[CBT] M.31
{:.mb-0}
- Both these traditions (the scholarly and Chan) went through periods of patronage and persecution, which left a lasting lesson on the impermanence of fame immortalized in poetry such as this.

[CBT] M.167
{:.mb-0}
- We end our section on China by reading this very famous story about the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School.

##### Robinson Chapter 9: Korea and Vietnam

- Many Pureland Buddhists have as their primary practice chanting the "nembutsu" of "Namu Amida Butsu" ("homage to Amitabha Buddha") in the hopes of being reborn in his Pure Land. 
- Here we read twenty famous verses by Hōnen that reflect the depths of this practice.

[CBT] M.27, M.102
{:.mb-0}
- Japanese Buddhists are famous for their patient austerity.

[CBT] M.81
{:.mb-0}
- Yet they often have a rather lenient attitude towards e.g. alcohol.

[CBT] M.105, M.159
{:.mb-0}
- A Bodhisattva can make vows to delay their awakening in order to construct an elaborate and appealing "Buddha field" into which their followers may be reborn. Here we read the vows of the Buddha Amitabha, whose worship is especially popular in Japanese Buddhism.

[CBT] M.39, M.74
{:.mb-0}
- And here we read about the vast array of Buddha fields across the ocean-like multiverse and how to attain rebirth in one.

[CBT] M.156
{:.mb-0}
- On the other hand, all such notions (even up to enlightenment itself) are in fact empty, and there is actually nothing to attain.

{% include content_blurb.html category="essays" slug="amida-buddha_bloom-a" %}
- In this way, we can understand Pure Land Buddhism at multiple levels: the mythic, the psychological, and the non-dual.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="bridging-the-two-vehicles_bodhi" %}
- As the Dhamma comes West, and globalization connects us all, we have a unique opportunity now to bridge the gaps that history and geography created... but only if we choose to do so.

And with that, we're now finished with Part 1 of our course! **History is now yours to make!**
{:.mt-4}
