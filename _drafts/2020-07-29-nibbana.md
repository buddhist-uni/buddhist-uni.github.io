title: "A New Reading List on *Nibbāna*"
---

This month I'm proud to announce the addition of [a bibliography on *nibbāna*]({% link _tags/nibbana.md %}).

I'm especially happy to have finally added to the library:

{% include inline_content.html category='essay' slug='purpose-of-meditation_mahasi' %}
- Mahasi Sayadaw's classic summary of the *Visuddhimagga* provides an excellent (if dense!) map of the path.

{% assign cslugs = 'arahattamagga-arahattaphala_mahabua' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

Wishing you a swift attainment,  
Than Khemarato  
The Librarian
