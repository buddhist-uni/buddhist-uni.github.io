This month, we expand our Mahayana offerings with new sections of the library dedicated to [Chan (Zen)](/tags/chan) and [Vajrayana](/tags/tantric) Buddhism.

Something something [Medieval Chinese Exegesis on the Meaning and Function of Dhāraṇī Language](/content/articles/why-not-translate-spells_overbey-ryan) and quote from [Hakuin’s Song of Zazen](/content/essays/hakuin-song-of-zazen):

> All beings by nature are Buddha,  
As ice by nature is water.  
Apart from water there is no ice;  
Apart from beings, no Buddha.  
How sad that people ignore the near  
And search for truth afar  

Signed,  
Khemarato Bhikkhu
