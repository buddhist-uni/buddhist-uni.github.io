title: Buddha in the PƒÅli Canon
---

This month saw a number of technical upgrades to the website and the addition of a new course syllabus on the Buddha.

The biggest news is that, thanks to a generous lay supporter, the site now has a proper URL: www.buddhistuniversity.net  I've also finally managed to add basic [search](/search/) functionality to the site, so you can now plumb the archives properly. It's brand new, so if you're having any issues, please let me know.
