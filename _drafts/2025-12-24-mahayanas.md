Today, we at OBU are proud to announce four new bibliographies for you on
Mahayana and the human world.

## Mahayana Buddhism's national forms

This month we've added three new bibliographies on:

- [**Buddhism in Japan**](/tags/japanese)
  - [A Zen priest explains the value of Buddhism's religious forms](/content/av/zen-forms_burk-domyo)
- [**Buddhism in Tibet**](/tags/tibetan)
  - [A brief 4 minutes on Tulkus](/content/av/reincarnation-in-tibetan-buddhism_gamble-ruth)
- [**Buddhism in Korea**](/tags/korean)
  - [This paper](/content/articles/social-stigmas-of-buddhist-monastics_gimhwansu) explores how Korea's distrust of renunciants hindered the emergence of lay Buddhist organizations in modern Korea, demonstrating how even modern, "secular" forms of Buddhism depend on the monastic sangha.

The eagle-eyed reader will no doubt be thinking here,
"Wait. Where is the section on Chinese Buddhism?"
Good question!
As Chinese Buddhism is such a large topic, we've decided to split it up into
multiple new library sections which we will be adding sometime next year.
So, stay tuned for that!

To hold you over until then,
[here is a documentary about the hermits of the Zhongnan Mountains](/content/av/amongst-white-clouds_burger-edward)
which is well worth a watch!

## The Material World

And to help advance understanding of our world,
this month OBU is also proud to launch a new, secular section on:

- [**Things**](/tags/things)

Here you can learn about how humans use the material of our environment for
their own ends and about the impacts of that use.
To highlight one striking example I learned while putting together this bibliography:

Did you know that burning a paraffin wax candle creates
[100 000 times more heat](/content/essays/warming-from-fossil-fuels_caldeira-ken)
from its greenhouse gas effects than it does from the immediate act of burning?

Wishing you a happy holidays and [a hope-filled new year](/content/av/to-the-new-year_poetry-for-all),
