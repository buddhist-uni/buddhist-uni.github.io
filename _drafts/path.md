## The Noble Eightfold Path

Before we begin the course proper, let’s first do a short "mini-course" to give us an overview of the Path and where we're headed:

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="mn117" %}

{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="noble-eightfold-path_bodhi" %}
- Bhikkhu Bodhi’s classic introduction to the Buddhist Path.

{% include inline_content.html category="booklets" slug="in-his-own-words_nyanamoli" %}
- Along with the Buddha's own words on the subject, as compiled by Bhikkhu Nyanamoli.


I recommend reading MN 117 first as a preview, then reading Nyanamoli’s anthology section-by-section alongside Bhikkhu Bodhi’s analysis. This way, you'll get a taste of the original teachings followed closely by their elucidation:
1. MN 117
1. Bodhi: Preface
2. Nyanamoli: What is the Dhamma? –> The Truth of Cessation
3. Bodhi: Part 1 (The Way to the End of Suffering)
4. Nyanamoli: Right View
5. Bodhi: Right View
8. …
9. Nyanamoli: In Practice and The Means
9. Bodhi: The Development of Wisdom
9. Nyanamoli: The End
9. Bodhi: Epilogue

Having thus gotten the traditional map of the Path, we can now begin exploring its terrain.
