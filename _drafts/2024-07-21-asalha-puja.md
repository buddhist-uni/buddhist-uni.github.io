title: "Happy Āsāḷha Pūjā!"
---

Today is Āsāḷha Pūjā, the last day before the annual rains retreat, and to celebrate the occasion I'm happy to announce a significant expansion of our _free_ library into the history of Buddhism and the workings of the mind with the launch of **seven** new bibliographies: 

# Medieval Buddhism
We can divide the history of Buddhism very roughly into three periods: its early growth in India, its spread across Asia, and finally its global spread in the modern era.
Building on our earlier bibliographies covering the [first](/tags/indian) and [last](/tags/west) of these periods, today I'm happy to announce our new 
[**"Medieval Buddhism"** bibliography](/tags/medieval)
covering the religion's development outside of India.

The works listed cover many critical questions, such as
[what role Buddhism played in medieval Society](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/buddhism-society-in-medieval-estate-system_toshio-kuroda)
and even
[how good scholars came to write apocryphal sūtras](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/t309_nattier-jan).

# Theravada Roots
For those interested exclusively in [**the history of the Theravāda tradition**](/tags/theravada-roots),
we are pleased to provide a bibliography focusing on its history in particular.

It explores [the sometimes surprising politics](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/beggars-and-buddhas-politics-humor-in-vessantara-jataka-in-thailand_bowie-katherine-a)
around the Pali texts.

# The Theravada Canon
And for those interested in diving into the Pāli texts themselves, we've pleased to now provide three new bibliographies on
[the rebirth stories](/tags/rebirth-stories) and [beautiful poetry](/tags/canonical-poetry)
found in the Pāli Canon, as well as a bibliography on [Abhidhamma Studies](/tags/abhidhamma)
and [a lecture series on the Visuddhimagga](https://buddhistuniversity.net/series/visuddhimagga-for-sutta-lovers_sujato).

In particular, I'd like to highlight here a new project by our friend "ReadingFaithfully" to create [a comprehensive index of the entire Sutta Pitaka](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/reference/cips).
The project is not yet complete, but is already a wonderful resource for exploring the Suttas and is highly recommended!

# The Intellect
And for those looking for a more secular explanation for the workings of the thinking mind,
[**The Intellect** bibliography](/tags/intellect)
collects a number of works exploring how we learn
[(or un-learn!) according to science](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/belief-traps-tackling-inertia-of-harmful_scheffer-marten-et-al).


# Media Literacy
Because in [**Today's Multimedia World**](/tags/media) (another bibliography!),
where 
[rank misinformation](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/climate-denial_hbomberguy) (another great video!)
and ["attention fracking"](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/attention-fracking_burnett-d-g) (<- a stirring conversation!)
are increasing,
it's more important than ever to equip ourselves with real understanding and mindfulness.

# Stay Safe out there!
To that end, I hope that the above resources are helpful for you and I hope that you have much time over the coming months to peacefully practice according to the Buddha's precious instructions.

And, just in case it isn't peaceful, [here are a few first-aid tips](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/comprehensive-first-aid_red-cross) which I sincerely hope never become useful for you!

Wishing you the best this *vassa*,
