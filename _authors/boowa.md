Ajahn Maha Bua[a] (12 August 1913 â€“ 30 January 2011) was a Thai Buddhist monk. He was thought by many of his followers to be an arahant. He was a disciple of the esteemed forest master Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta, and was himself considered a master in the Thai Forest Tradition. Following the death of Ajahn Thate in 1994, he was considered to be the Ajahn Yai (or head monk) of the Thai Forest Tradition lineage until his death in 2011.
