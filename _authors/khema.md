Ayya Khema (1923â€“1997) was a German-American nun ordained in the Chan tradition, but with extensive experience around the world. She organized the first International Conference on Buddhist Women in 1987, which led to the foundation of Sakyadhita and helped to spearhead the revival of female monasticism. She was a leading teacher of Buddhist meditation in the West, and the author of several well-received books.
