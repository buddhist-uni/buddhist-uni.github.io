After reading Sanskrit with Pali at St Hugh’s College, Oxford (1986−1989), Kate Crosby studied at the University of Hamburg and the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka, before returning to Oxford to complete her DPhil in medieval Sri Lankan literature in 1999.
She combines textual research on Sanskrit, Pali and vernacular literature with fieldwork in mainland Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.
In addition to editions and translations, her publications cover the history, ethics and practices of Theravāda Buddhism.

Kate Crosby joined King’s College London as Professor of Buddhist Studies in April 2013 after being Director of the Centre of Buddhist Studies at SOAS.
In addition to teaching and continuing her own research, Professor Crosby also co-edits the international journal [Contemporary Buddhism](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showOpenAccess?journalCode=rcbh20).
