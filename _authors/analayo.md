title: "Bhikkhu Anālayo"

Born in Germany in 1962 and ordained in Sri Lanka in 1995, Bhikkhu Anālayo arrived too late to study with his inspiration—[Bhante Nyanaponika Thera]({% link _authors/nyanaponika.md %})—but stuck around anyway to study under a different Western monk: a certain "[Bhikkhu Bodhi]({% link _authors/bodhi.md %})."

In 2000, still studying in Sri Lanka, Bhikkhu Anālayo received a PhD in the _Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta_. He became interested in the Northern parallels to the Pāli Canon and quickly picked up Sanskrit, ancient Chinese, and Tibetan, publishing _Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna_ in 2013.

Today, Bhikkhu Anālayo is the preeminent comparative textual scholar of early Buddhism. His [prolific articles](https://www.buddhistinquiry.org/resources/offerings-analayo/publications/){:target="_blank"} can be found in most major journals of Buddhist Studies, and he is the author of several books on early Buddhism, some of which are available for free. He was a professor at the Numata Centre for Buddhist Studies at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/analayo/publications.htm){:target="_blank"} and co-founded the [Āgama Research Group](http://agamaresearch.dila.edu.tw/?page_id=48){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.25"}. He currently teaches and continues his research at the [Barre Center for Buddhist Studies](https://www.buddhistinquiry.org/teacher/bhikkhu-analayo/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} in Barre, Massachusetts.
