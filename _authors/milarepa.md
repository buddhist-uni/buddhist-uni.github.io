Jetsun Milarepa (11th–12th century) was a famed Tibetan siddha and spiritual poet, whose life is remembered as a powerful story of transformation. In his youth, he committed acts of murder through sorcery, but later came to deeply regret his actions. Seeking redemption, he turned to Buddhism and became a devoted student of Marpa the Translator, who was himself a disciple of the Indian master Naropa. Through intense ascetic practice and profound realization, Milarepa rose to become one of Tibet’s most celebrated yogis and mystical poets. His teachings and songs of spiritual insight left a lasting legacy, and he became the teacher of several legendary disciples, most notably Gampopa, who played a key role in the formation of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.
