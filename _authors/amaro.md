Born **J. C. Horner** (cousin of [I. B. Horner](/authors/horner)) in 1956, Ajahn Amaro was ordained in Thailand in 1979, leaving just two years later to help [Ajahn Sumedho](/authors/sumedho) establish Chithurst Monastery. In the early 1990s, Ajahn Amaro began making regular trips to California, where he eventually founded [Abhayagiri Monastery](/authors/abhayagiri) with [Ajahn Pasanno](/authors/pasanno). In 2010, Ajahn Amaro left California and returned to England to take over leadership of [Amaravati Monastery](/publishers/amaravati), where he remains.
