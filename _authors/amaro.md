In the early 1990s, Ajahn Amaro began making regular trips to California, where he eventually founded [Abhayagiri Monastery]({% link _authors/abhayagiri.md %}) with [Ajahn Pasanno]({% link _authors/pasanno.md %}). In 2010, Ajahn Amaro left California and returned to England to take over leadership of Amaravati Monastery, where he remains.
