Than Ajahn Suchart Abhijāto was born in Thailand in 1947 and received a Bachelor's of Science degree in Civil Engineering from California State University before returning to Thailand to manage an ice cream shop in Pattaya. Receiving a copy of [Wheel 186](https://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh186){:target="_blank"} from a tourist, he realized the importance of meditation and wrote to the BPS requesting more. He received from them a copy of the [Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta](https://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh019){:target="_blank"} which he then chanted and practiced diligently. Leaving his job in 1974 to meditate full time, he ordained at Wat Bowon in 1975 with the help of [Bhikkhu Khantipalo]({% link _authors/mills-laurence.md %}) and then traveled to Wat Pa Baan Taad where he would train under [Luangta Maha Bua]({% link _authors/mahabua.md %}) for the next nine years.

For his tenth rains, Ajahn Suchart came back to Pattaya where he has remained ever since. You can find his teachings and more at [PhraSuchart.com](https://www.phrasuchart.com/en/){:target="_blank"}.
