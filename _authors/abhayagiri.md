Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, in Redwood Valley California, was the first monastery in the United States to be established by followers of Ajahn Chah, a respected master of the Thai Forest Tradition.

In 1988, lay disciples of Ajahn Chah's student [Ajahn Sumedho](/authors/sumedho) formed the Sanghapāla Foundation with the mission of creating a branch monastery in the lineage of Ajahn Chah. In 1990, [Ajahn Amaro](/authors/amaro) accompanied Ajahn Sumedho to California and became the central teacher for the Californians.

Efforts to establish a California monastery moved slowly until 1995, when Venerable Master Hsüan Hua, the founding abbot of [The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB)](http://www.cttbusa.org/), approached his death. He instructed his students to give Ajahn Chah’s disciples 120 acres of CTTB-owned forested property in Redwood Valley. Master Hua had made a point of stating that it had been his life’s dream to bring the northern and southern traditions of Buddhism together again. His open-hearted offering enabled the communities (just 15 miles apart) to be physically close and to relate to each other with an atmosphere of mutual respect and harmony.

Venerable [Ajahn Pasanno](/authors/pasanno) and Venerable Ajahn Amaro guided the monastery as co-abbots starting in 1996. In 2010, Ajahn Amaro accepted an invitation to serve as abbot of [Amaravati Buddhist Monastery](/publishers/amaravati) in England, leaving Ajahn Pasanno to lead the community for the next eight years. In the spring of 2018, Ajahn Pasanno stepped back from his role of abbot to enter a year-long retreat, after which he returned to Abhayagiri as its Guiding Elder. The monastery is now under the leadership of Ajahn Ñāniko.
