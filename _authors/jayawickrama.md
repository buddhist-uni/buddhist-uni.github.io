Nicholas Abeydeera Jayawickrama (1920–2012) was a Sri Lankan scholar of Pāli Buddhist texts.

His 1947 PhD thesis for the University of London (linked below) is still the definitive work on the Sutta Nipāta—apart from [the *Paramatthajotikā* and *Niddesa*](https://wisdomexperience.org/product/suttanipata/) themselves, of course—and he contributed translations for several other important Pāli texts for the Pāli Text Society throughout his career.

He taught at the University of Ceylon and then Kelaniya University from his graduation until his retirement in 1985.
