A German scholar (b. 1901), Ven. Nyanaponika Thera ordained in Sri Lanka in 1936 after fleeing the Nazis. He was imprisoned by the British Empire as a possible spy for the duration of World War II, completing (from prison) German translations of the _Suttanipata_, _Dhammasangani_, and _Satipaṭṭhāna_.

After the war, he traveled to Burma where he helped the sixth council publish their edition of the Pāli Canon and learned vipassana meditation from [Mahasi Sayadaw](/authors/mahasi) himself, later writing _The Heart of Buddhist Meditation_ about the experience.

But Ven Nyanaponika Thera is most famous for co-founding the [Buddhist Publication Society](/publishers/bps) in 1958, where he published hundreds of works on Theravāda Buddhism in English.

He died in Sri Lanka on October 19, 1994 on the last day of his 58th rains.
