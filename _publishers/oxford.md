Oxford has the largest (and [second oldest]({% link _publishers/cambridge.md %})) university press in the world, with offices in 50 countries and over 6000 titles published per year.

In the late 19th century, OUP published the [Sacred Books of the East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Books_of_the_East) series which included many groundbreaking translations from the Buddhist canon.
