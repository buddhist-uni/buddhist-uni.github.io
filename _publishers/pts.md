The Pali Text Society was founded in 1881 by [T. W. Rhys Davids]({% link _authors/rhys-davids.md %}) "to foster and promote the study of Pāli texts." It publishes Pāli texts in Roman characters, translations in the English language, and related reference materials---including dictionaries, a concordance, Pāli textbooks, and an academic journal.
