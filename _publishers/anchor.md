Anchor Press was founded in the early 1900s by a partner at a London firm to produce charts and time-tables for the British Admiralty. In 1918, the business was purchased and began printing inexpensive books for the general public, becoming the largest book printer in the UK after the war.

Anchor Books was eventually acquired by Doubleday in the 1980s, where it still operates as an imprint, today of Penguin Random House.
