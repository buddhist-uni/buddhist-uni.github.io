The Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute is a large publisher of Open Access research.

MDPI's software makes it trivially easy for someone to start a new, pay-to-publish journal with a minimum of editorial oversight,
making MDPI host to a profusion of "predatory" journals of mixed quality.
Reader caution is advised when perusing their archives,
