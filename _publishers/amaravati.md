Established in the 1980s by [Ajahn Sumedho]({% link _authors/sumedho.md %}), Amaravati Buddhist Monastery is the largest (but far from the only!) Ajahn Chah branch temple in the UK. In addition to monks, Amaravati has a somewhat unique community of "sīladhārā" nuns who have taken on an unorthodox set of precepts.
