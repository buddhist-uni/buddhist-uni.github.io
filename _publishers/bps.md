Founded in 1958 in Kandy by A.S. Karunaratna, Richard Abeyasekera, and [Ven. Nyanaponika Thera](/authors/nyanaponika), the BPS became one of the premier publishers of English-language, Theravāda Buddhist material during the 60s through the 80s and 90s during the massive growth in interest from the anglophone world. Today, most of their publications are available free of charge.
