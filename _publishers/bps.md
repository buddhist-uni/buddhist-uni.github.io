Nyanaponika Thera]({% link _authors/nyanaponika.md %}), the BPS became one of the premier publishers of English-language, Theravada Buddhist material during the 60s through the 80s and 90s during the massive growth in interest from the anglophone world. Today, most of their publications are available free of charge.
