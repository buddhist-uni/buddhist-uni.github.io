[Lama Thubten Yeshe]({% link _authors/yeshe.md %}) and Lama Zopa Rinpoche in 1975 established the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, whose vision of "publications for wisdom culture" led to the founding of Wisdom Publications in 1983. Today, Wisdom publishes videos, online courses, [a podcast](https://wisdomexperience.org/podcasts/), and a journal, having [outsourced their monographs](https://www.lionsroar.com/wisdom-publications-launches-new-site-expands-reach-through-freshly-inked-deal-with-simon-schuster/) to [Simon & Schuster](https://www.simonandschuster.com/search/books/Imprint-Wisdom-Publications/_/N-1z12i96) in 2014.
