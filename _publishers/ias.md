The Institute for Anarchist Studies was founded in 1996 by Chuck Morse, with the purpose of providing grants to radical writers and translators around the world. Over the years, it expanded beyond the grant-giving program to include other projects, including publishing the journal _Perspectives on Anarchist Theory_ and various other books and booklets.
