The Pariyatti Book Service was started in 1986 by students of S.N. Goenka as a for-profit publisher and distributor of Theravada books and audio cassette tapes in America. They merged with _Vipassana Research Publications of America_ and later entered into agreements with both [BPS Kandy]({% link _publishers/bps.md %}) and [PTS Bristol]({% link _publishers/pts.md %}) to distribute their books in America, a role they continue to fill today. Pariyatti reincorporated as a non-profit in 2002.
