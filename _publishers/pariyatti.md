The Pariyatti Book Service was started in 1986 by students of S.N. Goenka as a for-profit publisher and distributor of Theravāda books and audio cassette tapes in America. They merged with _Vipassana Research Publications of America_ and later entered into agreements with both [BPS Kandy](/publishers/bps) and [PTS Bristol](/publishers/pts) to distribute their books in America, a role they continue to fill today. Pariyatti reincorporated as a non-profit in 2002.
