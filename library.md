The same, great content featured in [the courses]({% link courses.md %}) along with other recommendations for further study.

You can explore the library by:
{:.mb-0}

### [<i class="fas fa-tag"></i> Topic]({% link tags.md %})
Find a topic that interests you in the [topic index]({% link tags.md %}) or simply start from the top ([at "_Buddhism_")]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}) and then explore by clicking on the "[Subtopic](/tags/buddhism#children)" links at the bottom of the page. (Note that individual items in the library may appear in multiple bibliographies if tagged with multiple subjects.)

#### [<i class="fas fa-medal"></i> Best Of The Library]({% link blog.md %}#updates)
For a currated, chronological list of the best additions to the library, see (and subscribe to!) [the newsletter]({% link blog.md %}) which highlights the best new arrivals every month or so.

### [<i class="fas fa-search"></i> Search]({% link search.html %})
Type in what you're looking for and see what comes up!

#### [<i class="fas fa-dice"></i> Random]({% link random.html %})
Or explore the breadth of our recommendations in a more serendipitous way.

#### [<i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Author]({% link authors.md %})
If there's a particular author you want to hear more from or you just want to get a sense of who is represented here, you can [find a partial list of our authors here]({% link authors.md %}).

#### [<i class="fas fa-photo-video"></i> Content Type]({% link _categories/index.md %})
In the mood to curl up with [a good book]({% link _categories/booklets.md %})? Or perhaps looking for [a talk]({% link _categories/av.md %}) to listen to?  Our listing [by content type]({% link _categories/index.md %}) is the canonical list of everything in the library.

### [<i class="fab fa-google-drive"></i> Google Drive&#8482;](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}
This website started off as a Google Drive folder, which still serves as this website's primary file server. The Google Drive folder contains roughly the same content as this site, arranged similarly, just missing a few links here and there and containing a few extra goodies that haven't yet found their way over here. If you're looking for offline saving or are an avid user of Google Drive, this link is for you.

### <i class="fas fa-database"></i> For Librarians, Academics, and Other Collectors

{% if site.show_bibtex %}
You can download [the entire library as a Bibtex Database (`.bib`) file here]({% link content.bib %}){:ga-on="click" ga-event-category="Bibtex" ga-event-action="download" ga-event-label="content.bib" ga-event-value="1"}, suitable for importing into your favorite reference manager. If you need the database in another format (json? RIS? MARC?), please send me an email and I'll be happy to write a converter for you.{% endif %}

While most of the content here can be found via [the original publishers']({% link publishers.html %}), [journals']({% link journals.html %}) and [miscellaneous other]({% link sources.md %}) websites, some of the items in this library can't be found elsewhere. For those, see [the exclusive content page]({% link exclusive.md %}) or [download them all at once via this link](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/exclusive_01/archive/main.zip)).
