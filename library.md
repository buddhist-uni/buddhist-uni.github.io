The same, great content featured in [the courses]({% link courses.md %}) along with other excellent works which I've found helpful in my own studies.

You can explore the library by:

### [<i class="fas fa-tag"></i> Topic]({% link tags.md %}) (if you're unsure, [Start Here!]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}))
Either search the [topic index]({% link tags.md %}) for a topic you're interested in or [start from the top ("_Buddhism_")]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}) and drill down using the "Subtopic" links.

#### [<i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Author]({% link authors.md %})
If there's a particular author you want to hear more from or you just want to get a sense of who is represented here, you can [find a list of our authors here]({% link authors.md %}).

#### [<i class="fas fa-photo-video"></i> Content Type]({% link content/index.md %})
In the mood to curl up with [a good book]({% link content/monographs.md %})? Or perhaps looking for [a dhamma talk]({% link content/av.md %}) to listen to? Whatever you're looking for, you can [find it by type here]({% link content/index.md %}).

### Or on [<i class="fab fa-google-drive"></i> Google Drive&#8482;](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r)
All the content on this site and more can be found in
[my rather large Google Drive Library](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r).

Best of all, if you click the options menu <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-h"></i>  â€“> "[Add to My Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375057?&hl=en#7293876)" on the main folder, you can get the entire library on all your devices in just two clicks. Then you can save files offline on your phone (or tablet) to study or listen to on the go in [the Google Drive app](https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/) or search the library ([including _inside_ PDFs](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375114)) using Drive's powerful, built-in search function. And because the files were uploaded by my account, adding them to your drive doesn't use _any_ of your own storage quota. 

That's right! You can take the entire library with you everywhere you go, for absolutely free[^disclaimer]

### Additional Information

To learn (and stay informed) about the latest additions to the library, [see the blog]({% link blog.md %}).

And while most of the content collected here can be found on [other websites]({% link sources.md %}), [some of it can't]({% link exclusive.md %}). To find the commercial/copyrighted works recommended here for free, you'll have to resort to more traditional libraries.
