The same, great content featured in [the courses]({% link courses.md %}) along with other works I've found helpful in my own studies.

You can explore the library by:

### [<i class="fas fa-tag"></i> Topic]({% link tags.md %})
Either search the [topic index]({% link tags.md %}) for a topic you're interested in or [start from the top ("_Buddhism_")]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}) and drill down using the "Subtopic" links.

#### [<i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Author]({% link authors.md %})
If there's a particular author you want to hear more from or you just want to get a sense of who is represented here, you can [find a list of our authors here]({% link authors.md %}).

#### [<i class="fas fa-photo-video"></i> Content Type]({% link _categories/index.md %})
In the mood to curl up with [a good book]({% link _categories/monographs.md %})? Or perhaps looking for [a talk]({% link _categories/av.md %}) to listen to? Whatever you're looking for, you can [find it by type here]({% link _categories/index.md %}).

### Or on [<i class="fab fa-google-drive"></i> Google Drive&#8482;](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}
All the content on this site and more can be found in
[my huge Google Drive Library](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}.

### Additional Information

For a currated list of the very best of the library, see (and subscribe to!) [the newsletter]({% link blog.md %}) which highlights my favorite arrivals.

{% if site.show_bibtex %}
You can download [the entire library as a Bibtex Database (`.bib`) file here]({% link content.bib %}){:ga-on="click" ga-event-category="Bibtex" ga-event-action="download" ga-event-label="content.bib" ga-event-value="1"}.
{% endif %}

And while most of the content collected here can be found on [other websites]({% link sources.md %}), some of it can't. For those, see the [exclusive content page]({% link exclusive.md %}).
