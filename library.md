The same, great content featured in [the courses]({% link courses.md %}) along with other recommendations for further study.

You can explore the library by:
{:.mb-0}

### [<i class="fas fa-tag"></i> Topics]({% link tags.html %})
Find a topic that interests you in the topic index or simply start from the top ([at "_Buddhism_")]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}) and explore the library "room by room" by clicking on the "[Subtopic links](/tags/buddhism#children)" at the bottom of each bibliography. (Note that individual items in the library may appear in multiple bibliographies if they are tagged with multiple subjects.)

### [<i class="fas fa-medal"></i> Timeline]({% link highlights.html %})
Here you'll find the latest and greatest publications in the library sorted by year.

### [<i class="fas fa-search"></i> Search]({% link search.html %})
Type in what you're looking for and see what comes up!

### [<i class="fas fa-dice"></i> Random]({% link random.html %})
Or explore the breadth of our recommendations in a more serendipitous way.

### [<i class="fas fa-user-edit"></i> Author]({% link authors.md %})
If there's a particular author you want to hear more from or you just want to get a sense of who is represented here, you can find a partial list of our authors here.

### [<i class="fas fa-photo-video"></i> Content Type]({% link _categories/index.md %})
The content type pages contain the canonical list of everything in the library.

### [<i class="fab fa-google-drive"></i> Google Drive&#8482;](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}
This website started off as a Google Drive folder, which still serves as this website's primary file server. The Google Drive folder contains roughly the same content as this site, arranged similarly, just missing a few links here and there and containing a few extra goodies that haven't yet found their way over here. If you're an avid user of Google Drive, this link is for you.

### <i class="fas fa-database"></i> For Librarians, Academics, and Other Collectors

{% if site.show_bibtex %}
You can download [the entire library as a Bibtex Database (`.bib`) file here]({% link content.bib %}){:ga-event-value="1"}, suitable for importing into your favorite reference manager. You can find [an RSS Feed of all items in the library here](/feed/content.xml).{% endif %}

While most of the content here can be found via [the original publishers']({% link publishers.html %}), [journals']({% link journals.html %}) and [miscellaneous other]({% link sources.md %}) websites, some of the items in this library can't be found elsewhere. For those, see [the list of our exclusive content]({% link exclusive.md %}).

For more information about how the library is built, see [our Collection Development Policy](/COLLECTION_POLICY).
