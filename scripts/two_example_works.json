It has not been previously submitted for any other degree at this or any other university.  Where other sources are quoted, full references are given.Alexander R\u00f6delOctober 2007- iii -AcknowledgementsI am very much indebted to my supervisors, Steven Sutcliffe and Jeanne Openshaw, for  providing me with their expertise in their respective academic fields and their friendly  support \u2013 within and outside Religious Studies. Steven Sutcliffe, with whom  discussions were  always as lengthy as they were fruitful, further stimulated my interest in method and theory.  He has always been an impressively vast and unpretentious source of  all-round knowledge in the field of Religionswissenschaft, when critically commenting on my drafts. Jean Openshaw, who also helped me to shape my ideas for this study, particularly  influenced my perception of  ethnography as well as identities and also familiarised me with the conventions of  the British academic system. I would also like to express my thanks to Paul Dundas, whose expertise in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain philosophy, Indian languages and societies was invaluably helpful and thought-provoking  \u2013  even  though  he  regularly  emphasised  that  he  was  \"only  a Sanskritist\". Moreover, I wish to thank Wanda Alberts, for reading and commenting on my drafts  and for, more than once, patiently bearing discussions about conceptions of  Buddhism, religion and Religionswissenschaft as a discipline. I am also grateful to  Ulla Schmid for her expertise in European philosophy and Abdurishid Yakup for his linguistic competence. Furthermore, I would like to thank Helen Waterhouse, Peter Schalk,  Katja Triplett and James Cox for their help, references and shared thoughts.Janet  and Clare O'Sullivan were not only influential  for  my own construction of British/English/Scottish culture, but also deserve my sincere gratitude for proofreading this study. For his translations and help with the Thai language, I wish to thank Pavis  Devahasadin na Ayutaya.Moreover,  I  am very  thankful  to  Chris  Johnson,  Sho Tsuji,  Sara  Saab,  Bernhard Lange, Christoph Wagenseil, Doreen Wohlrab, Gritt Klinkhammer, Peter Br\u00e4unlein, Ian Asteley  and  Albertina  Nugteren  for  their  friendly  support  and/or  references.  In addition, I wish to thank Philip Almond and Philip Mellor for giving me permission to  quote from unpublished material as well as Thessa Ploos van Amstel for kindly sending me her PhD dissertation.- iv -A great thanks goes to the various Buddhist individuals whom I met and with whom I had interesting, often exceptional conversations that reminded me of  the distinctive character of  the academic business. They often challenged my own presuppositions and drew my attention to new spaces within the activity spectrum of  their respective groups.  Without their friendliness, insight and cooperation, it would have not been possible for  me to learn anything about what people with a Buddhist identity actually do.All the above individuals have, in one way or another, contributed to my study \u2013 even  though some of  them may certainly not agree with my argumentation. Nevertheless, all mistakes, weak arguments and incoherences in this study are, of  course, mine.Finally,  I wish to thank my family for their caring encouragement and would like to express my gratitude to the institution of  and the individuals from the Studienstiftung des  deutschen Volkes (German National Academic Foundation).  Their generous financial and academic  support  enabled  me  to  actually  pursue  my  studies  at  the  University  of Edinburgh. Without them, I would have never been able to study at this institution,  which,  lamentably,  has  not  escaped  the  outcome  of  currently  prevailing  neo-liberal ideologies: namely, the transformation of  education and knowledge into commodities, thus shaping a university environment where, at the least on a student level,  credit-point  discussions and assignment concerns appear to dominate over academic contents.A note on languages, translations and research ethicsIn Sanskrit,  Pali  and Thai words,  I  follow the authors I  am quoting in their  use of diacritics. I also use diacritics whenever there is no English equivalent to a word. For better readability, I use the common phonetic transcription of  Tibetan terms instead of the Wylie system. All translations from German into English are mine; when quoted for the first time, an excerpt of  the original quote is given in the footnotes. Translations from Thai are by Pavis Devahasadin na Ayutaya. During my fieldwork, I was in contact  with numerous individuals  who provided me with information.  However,  to protect their anonymity, I refer specifically only to those persons who have decided themselves  to publicly participate in the discourse on Buddhism (e.g., in newspaper articles).- v -List of  illustrations, photographs and tablesUnless otherwise stated, all illustrations, photographs and tables are my own workIllustration 1: Elements and levels of  the discourse on Buddhism.................................................... 06Illustration 2: Focus of  the study ...................................................................................................07Illustration 3: WCS stimulus array ....................................................................................................16Illustration 4: English naming distribution..................................................................................... 16Illustration 5: Himba naming distribution......................................................................................17Illustration 6: Transfer of  European distinctions onto a                       fictitious non-European spectrum of  world perception...............................................18Photograph 1: Main temple at Samy\u00e9 Ling ..................................................................................40Photograph 2: Wat Dhammapadipa - front...................................................................................41Photograph 3: Glasgow Buddhist Centre - entrance....................................................................... 43Photograph 4: Glasgow Buddhist Centre - library......................................................................... 44Photograph 5: Glasgow Buddhist Centre - meditation room...........................................................44Photograph 6 Holy Island - main building.................................................................................... 55Photograph 7: Holy Island - Mandala garden............................................................................... 55Photograph 8: Wat Dhammapadipa - 'shrine' room......................................................................67Table 1: People with a Buddhist identity in Great Britain/United Kingdom....................................42Table 2: Diversity of  Buddhist activities in Scotland........................................................................75- vi -Table of  ContentsAbstract/License/Thesis declaration..................................................................................................iiiAcknowledgements..............................................................................................................................ivA note on language, translations and research ethics.............................................................................vList of  illustrations, photographs and tables....................................................................................... vi 1 Introduction..........................................................................................................1 1.1 What, if  anything, is Buddhism?

The bhikkhu declares that 'Nagasena' is no more than a  given name and explains that there is no self, no continuous person (puggala) masked behind this name. However, the king is not convinced by Nagasena's rejection of  a self  and attempts to comprehend what Nagasena actually means by his counter-intuitive statement:Milinda: \"Well, then sir, is your physical form [...] 'Nagasena'?\"Nagasena: \"No, your majesty.\"\"Are feelings [...] 'Nagasena'?\"\"No, your majesty.\"\"Are perceptions  [...] 'Nagasena'?\"\"No, your majesty.\" [...]\"Is consciousness [...] 'Nagasena'?\"\"No, your majesty.\"\"Perhaps the five skandhas all together [...] are they 'Nagasena'?\"\"No, your majesty.\"Learning that 'Nagasena' is not a 'person', Milinda is perplexed by the paradox that he nonetheless  is  able  to perceive  Nagasena and,  consequently,  accuses  the  bhikkhu of lying. Turning the tables, Nagasena starts to ask  about the nature of  the king's chariot, in which the king had arrived to meet the bhikkhu:Nagasena: \"[Y]our majesty, tell me what is the chariot.       Is the pole the chariot?\"Milinda: \"No, sir.\"\"Is the axle the chariot?\"\"No, sir.\" [...] \"Is the goad the chariot?\"\"No, sir.\"\"Perhaps, your majesty, the pole, the axle, [...] and the goad all together - are they the chariot?\"No, sir, they are not.\"\"Then, your majesty, is it something other than the pole, the axle [...],   and the goad that is the chariot?\"\"No, sir, it is not.\"\"Well, your majesty, [...] I do not find any chariot.   'Chariot' is but a sound. What is this chariot?\"Defeated by these questions, the story tells us, Milinda is admits his own contradictions and finally  agrees with Nagasena's  point.  The king even concludes that  \"[t]he word 1 This  question  is  borrowed  from  Jonathan  Silk's  (2002)  article What,  if  anything,  is  Mahayana Buddhism?, where he attempts to provide an answer inspired by biological taxonomy.2 Mil  2.1.1  (25);  Source:  Treckner  V.  (ed.,  translator),  The Milindapa\u00f1ho,  1986,  Pali  Text  Society London, quoted in Strong [1995]2002:93. - 2 -chariot comes into existence, dependent on the pole, dependent on the axle,  the wheels  [...], the goad; it is a designation, a description, an appellation, a name.\" Consequently, Nagasena replies: \"You truly understand the chariot! In the same way, [...] the word Nagasena comes into existence [...]. It is a designation [...], nothing but a name. But in the final analysis, the ultimate sense, there is no Person [puggala] to be found herein.\" (emphasis in original)For the following study it is not necessary to examine different concepts of anatta3 or to speculate about the historical impact of  the above text. Leaving aside its idea-historical context  for  now,  this brief  extract  of  the  Milindapa\u00f1ha  illustrates  how a  particular paradox, structurally analogous to the Sorites paradox4,  can be used to postulate and justify claims about empirically non-accessible, or to be more precise, \"non-falsifiable alternate realities\" (Cox 2006:236-237; 2007:76, 83).  Of  course, it is Nagasena himself  who creates this paradox: It is him who applies formal logic to the vagueness and fuzziness of  language; i.e. he attempts to assess a non-defined,  context-dependent  term  by  means  of  definition.  Because  Nagasena proposes a linear set of  characteristics to apprehend a so-called strong emergence, the answers to any of  his questions must be no. Through this, Nagasena's chariot analogy implies and finally convinces the king that neither is there an essence within the concept 'chariot' nor, mutatis mutandis, within the concept 'person'.  1.1.2  Answers in terms of  a field of  studyConfronted with the above evaluation of  'chariot' and 'person', one might ask whether  this could also be true for the concept 'Buddhism'. Is it a designation, a description,  nothing but a name, so that in the final analysis there is nothing to be found therein? \"Perhaps the  real  'essence'  of  Buddhism is  its  teaching that  there  is  no 'essence'  in anything\", suggests Robert Bluck (2006:186) in his study of  \"British Buddhism\". By contrast,  the  Buddhist  movement Friends of  the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO 2007a) claim that \"the essence of  Buddhism is timeless and universal. But the forms it takes always adapt according to context.\" What is more, P. Lakshmi Narasu ([1907]1993) or 3 For details see Collins 1982.4 The Sorites paradox is also called the paradox of  the heap (heap: English for Greek 'sor\u00f3s'):  If n grains form a heap, then surely n-1 would still form a heap. However, at what point do n grains not form a heap anymore?- 3 -Edward Conze ([1951]1957) even dedicated entire books to The essence  of  Buddhism or Buddhism: its essence and development, respectively.The above are only four of  various examples providing evidence that 'Buddhism' is  not 'empty' for everybody and \u2013 as the social sciences regard praj\u00f1aptimatra or su\u00f1\u00f1ata  metaphysics  as socially  constructed,  institutionalised  realities  (Berger/Luckmann [1966]1999) \u2013 cannot be empty. Indeed, since this concept emerged in the 19th century 5, people  have  always  felt  compelled  to  fill  it;  functionally  speaking,  'Buddhism'  is comprised  of  numerous  ideas,  thoughts,  disputes  and  discourses,  which  may  be summarised in the above question 'What, if  anything, is Buddhism?'.Various agents have provided numerous answers; many of  them constructed a core to  reify  and  identify  what  they  assumed  and  claimed  to  lie  behind  the  signifier 'Buddhism'. However, how do they fill the concept 'Buddhism' and what logic and rules are underpinning their selection processes? What makes them find different answers and in  what manner do they propagate their  convictions within the public  discourse on  Buddhism? These questions shall be further explored in this study.  5 Cf., e.g., Smith [1962]1978:61; Masuzawa 2005:125.- 4 - 1.2 Aims and foci of  this study 1.2.1  Object and presuppositions of  this studyAs indicated above, this study is not about Buddhism. It is about 'Buddhism': that is the (academic  and  public)  discourse  on  Buddhism,  which  is  constituted  by  different constructions of  Buddhism. For orthographical clarity, I shall use Buddhism to signify the idea of  an ontologised entity or religion, i.e. a first-degree construct (Sch\u00fctz 1971). In contrast,  the signifier 'Buddhism' (inverted single commas), as a second-degree construct, shall either point to Buddhism as a concept and term or to the discourse on Buddhism. In addition, I shall use double quotation marks, e.g. \"Buddhism\", whenever  quoting terms or phrases.The purpose of  replacing Buddhism with 'Buddhism' is to break with its familiarity. This is certainly arguable (see 2.2.3; Sweetman 2003:350); nonetheless, I consider this distinction  helpful  in  this  study  and  follow  scholars  such  as  Russell  McCutcheon (2003:256-260) or Steven Sutcliffe (2003:6, 9), whose use of  inverted commas indicate both a problematisation of  taxons and a focus on the reality-'manufacturing' side of essentialist  folk-terms such as 'religion', 'New Age' or 'Buddhism':\"In making this break we must remind ourselves that behind or before this discourse there lurks no purer, more cross-cultural thing [e.g., Buddhadharma; A.R.] [...]. Taking the social and historical scale of  analysis as our only available reference point, we come to  see  that  there  exists only  assorted  human  behaviors,  none any  more  or  less significant, meaningful, or valuable than any other.\"   (McCutcheon 2003:257)It  is  not my intention to present any data about an entity  existing dissociated from claims about this entity postulated by human beings. Hence, I am not concerned with adaptations, translations or transformations of  a vague set of  items6,  which different socially constructed authorities7 hold to be characteristically Buddhist. Rather, my interest is  directed at how different agents speak about and construct Buddhism; that is,  I am concerned with introducing an excerpt of  the discourse on Buddhism. I therefore consider this discourse as a framework actively constructed both by Buddhists (definition below) as elements of  their social identity (Jenkins 1996) as well as by scholars grouping together various phenomena under the category 'Buddhism'.8 6 Cf.,  e.g.,  Silk  2002:392:  \"[W]e  assume  that  all  Buddhist  texts  are  Buddhist\u2013but  really  without knowing what we mean by this, and without having formalized this feeling.\" (emphasis added)7 E.g., religious specialists, academics, state bureaucrats.8 Of  course, the categories 'scholar' and 'Buddhist' are not mutually exclusive.- 5 -Illustration 1: Elements and levels of  the discourse on Buddhism.{ Buddhism1,             Buddhism2,                 Buddhism3,          Buddhism4,   ... } } public discourse: 'Buddhism'\u0083U \u0080  \u0081  \u00e9Steven Engler (2004), however, has reminded us of  the lack of  theoretical foundations for  the application of  (social) constructionism9 in the study of  religions. Of  course, one major question must be addressed: Who or what actually constructs and why? Peter Berger  and  Thomas  Luckmann  ([1966]1999:64-65),  for  instance,  only  mention  the dialectic process between society as a human product and the human being itself, being a  product  of  society.  To  my  knowledge,  a  consensus  has  not  yet  been  found  and whereas some scholars may rely on cognitivist accounts (Engler 2004:308), others such as Tim Murphey (2000:401) see the solution in discourse theory which \"translat[es] the constructive activity out of  subjectivity and into discourse\" (see 1.3.2).The  above  outline,  of  course,  sets  limits  to  the  study:  I shall  not  consider  any cognitive, sociological, historical or any other explanations of  the question why human beings construct essences or ontologise categories.What is  more, I shall use Scotland as a geo-political boundary to limit the field of research,  even though the concept of  nation-state societies  has been sophisticatedly contested (Urry 2000). A reason for this is the distinctive multi-presence of  Buddhist groups within an accessible area and spatially graspable region (see 2.3.3 and Sutcliffe 2003:13-14), with an own political identity (Urry 2000:153) and sufficient autonomy to create  distinctive  discourses  on  religion  (see,  e.g.,  SIFC  2001:2-3).  In  addition,  the Tibetan  Buddhist  centre  and  monastery  Samy\u00e9  Ling,  as  the  headquarters  of  a contemporary Buddhist global player, has had a strong influence on the development of 'Buddhism' in this North European country, which makes the Scottish case particularly interesting (see 2.4). 9 For a differentiation between 'constructionism' and 'constructivism' see Engler 2004:292.- 6 -\u201cBasically, Buddhism is z!\u201d\u201cI as a Buddhist would argue...\u201d\u201cBuddhism is x!\u201d\u201cAccording to Buddhism, we should do this...\u201dA further boundary is the selection of  individuals and groups who consciously use the concept 'Buddhism' and 'Buddhist' for their self-representation, which I regard as a phenomenon by itself. I am therefore adopting  Thomas Tweed's answer to 'Who is a  Buddhist?' as a definition of  'Buddhist':\"[S]elf-identification is a useful standard for defining religious identity, and not only because  it  avoids  [...]  essentialist  approaches  and  includes  the  greatest  range  of characters. It also uncovers much about the status and meaning of  the religion at a given  historical moment and in a given cultural setting.\"(Tweed 2002:27)In sum, my study concentrates upon two major topics:(1) It attempts to give an insight into a public discourse which is largely maintained by people with a Buddhist identity. Thereby, it is rooted in a Religionswissenschaft  framework  which  is  interested  in  the  question  how human agents  creatively structure  and  view  their  life-world  in  a  way  which  contemporary  study-of-religions discourses consider to be religious.10 By Religionswissenschaft I refer to the academic  study of  religions, which is  a  discipline within  the  humanities  and social  sciences. Religionswissenschaft distinguishes  itself  from  other  disciplines11 associated with the term 'religion(s)' in that it attempts, for instance,12 to develop academic  non-sui-generis approaches  to  religious  perspectives  and  behaviour without advocating one particular position.13(2) The thesis intends to locate the characteristics of  the Buddhism discourse within contemporary changes and developments in the 'European history of  religions' (see 4.2).10 In this study I understand religious as an adjective which refers to a human behaviour and activity (i.e. \"religioning\"; cf. Nye 1999, 2000) which I conceive of  as the construction of  meaning as well as orientation and to make sense of  one's (social) environment, world and life (i.e.  the process of creating Sinn- , Symbol-, Deutungs-  and Orientierungssysteme).  Cf.,  e.g., Waardenburg 1986:34,  Flasche 2000:164, Gladigow 1995:77.11 E.g., Christian and Muslim theologies.12 There are many more approaches to the academic study of  religion(s),  partly because a general consensus about the identity of Religionswissenschaft has not yet been found. For a selective variety see e.g. Hinnells 2005, Stolz 1999, Kippenberg 2003 and Antes et al. 2004a/ 2004b.13 Cf. the IAHR's self-understanding (IAHR [2006]2007), being a major force in the discourse on what constitutes Religionswissenschaft: \"[The International Association for the History of  Religions] is the preeminent international forum for the critical, analytical and cross-cultural study of  religion, past and present. The IAHR is not a forum for confessional, apologetical, or other similar concerns.\" - 7 -Illustration 2: Focus of  the studyScotland                                                                          Buddhist identity            (by definition)Groupsstudy focus 1.2.2  The shift from pragmatism to methodological issuesIn his introduction to \"The cultural translation of  Buddhism in England\" Philip Mellor (1989:8) notes a shift of  focus while he was investigating 'Buddhism' in England:\"The initial aim of  this thesis was to consider how Buddhism in England had adapted to being translated into a western cultural environment. [...] I had a fairly clear idea of what 'Buddhism' was and what it was not. [...] However, as my research progressed and the material at my disposal increased, it  became clear to me that 'Buddhism' was a problematic  category.  [...]  From  this  point  the  study  changed  quite  radically  and methodological problems assumed an absolutely central position.\"Even though my initial aim was to investigate why there were differences in the practice of  'western'  versus 'Asian'  Buddhists,  the shift  of  my focus of  study as  well  as  my concerns about methodology correspond very much to Mellor's statement.Consequently, I had to recall and reflect upon my education in Buddhism: media, school,  university.  Classes  in Religionswissenschaft and  Indology  had  provided  me with more facets of  a monolithic block. I had heard about Theravada, Mahayana, and A\u015boka. I  had  read  'major'  texts  and  had  learnt  about  Ambedkar  as  well  as  the  Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement. Introductions to Buddhism (e.g. Schumann [1976]1998, Gethin 1998,  Keown 1996),  describing its founder,  scriptures  and teachings,  cosmology and practices  had reinforced my initial  understanding of  Buddhism. Attempts to rethink these assumptions remained (and still remain) a challenge. My current conclusions of  this reflective process urge me to strongly question the  assumption that  there  is  any  deeper  logic  determining  distinct  'Buddhist  behaviour'. The only rationale I found is an ongoing ontologising activity carried out by past and present  advocates  of  Buddhism:  this  means,  the  persistent  transformation  of 'Buddhism' as a descriptive term, developed in the history of  philosophy/ literature, into the discourse of  human identities and human life-world.What is more, being concerned with human agency, I am highly sceptical about the analytical  usefulness  of  a  taxon  'Buddhism'  for  understanding  and  classifying,  for instance, contemporary social movements in Japan, Lanka, Europe or India. I therefore doubt  that  essentialist  notions  of  what  counts  as  Buddhist  behaviour  help  to comprehend phenomena such as the formation of  the European Buddhist Union or the increasing number of  people publicly presenting themselves as Buddhists. - 8 - 1.3 Methodology used in this study 1.3.1  Qualitative researchHubert Knoblauch (2003:28) and Martin Baumann (1998:7) note that one of  the major  changes in the study of  religions has been the shift from mainly textual approaches, predominately  preoccupied  with  elite  literature,  to  research  informed  by  qualitative methods.  Malory  Nye  (2000:450),  however,  points  out  that  this  shift  from what  he regards as Smartian phenomenonlogy, especially present in the UK, to methods from sociology and anthropology has failed to recognise further developments and critical  reflection present in these two disciplines.  Indeed,  despite the general  acceptance of  qualitative methodology, there has been, to my knowledge, little debate on it. Accounts by Baumann (1998) and Knoblauch (2003), the journal Fieldwork and Religion, one special issue in the NAASR journal Method & Theory in the Study of  Religions (Vol. 13, 2001) and a plea for \"qualitative empirical methodologies\" (Sutcliffe 2004a:xxvi; emphasis in original) within  the  BASR  can  be  regarded  as  but  exceptions  within  a  still  little-developed  discursive field. Hence, I had to base my own readings of  qualitative research also upon works from sociology (Flick 2005, Bryman 2004, Silverman 2001), which often lack the specific needs of  the study of  religions (cf. Knoblauch 2003:11-15). It  is  beyond the confines of  this study to produce an ethnography of   Buddhist groups in Scotland. Rather, it is an empirically informed study of  discourse production in three groups. My selection of  groups was based on my initial interest in how 'Asian' and 'western'  Buddhists14 practised Buddhism in different ways.  Hence,  I  specifically chose  three  Buddhist  movements  from  a  spectrum  of  membership  'socialisations' ranging from mainly European socialised members at one end to predominantly non-European socialised members at the other:(1) The Friends of  the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), a conglomeration of  groups perceiving themselves to be a 'western' Buddhist movement and predominantly comprised of  'converts'. (2) The mainly 'western' community around Samy\u00e9 Ling, which was founded by two Tibetan migrants and which has become known as the first Tibetan Buddhist centre and monastery in Europe. 14 For a problematisation of  these terms see 2.3.1.- 9 -(3) The predominantly Thai community around Wat Dhammapadipa in Edinburgh, which has strong ties with the Thai-Scottish Association and which is affiliated with Wat Buddhapadipa in London and the Bangkok Wat Mahathat.My contact to these three Buddhist groups can be described as participant observation. In all three groups, I took classes or lessons orientated at introducing Buddhism. Most fieldwork was carried out within the period of  September 2006 to April 2007.15 With the FWBO, I took a Buddhism introductory class and additionally visited the Edinburgh  Buddhist  Centre  several  times  for  meditation  and  discussion  gatherings. Furthermore,  I  visited  the  FWBO's  Buddhist  Centre  in  Glasgow  and  met  people involved with the FWBO outside of  centres.With respect to the Samy\u00e9 Ling community, I took a Buddhism introductory class aimed at school teachers at Samy\u00e9 Ling's monastery and visited a class at the Samy\u00e9 Dzong Edinburgh. Furthermore, I attended special events such as the celebrations of Samye Ling\u2019s 40th Anniversary as well as \"refuge\" and \"empowerment\" gatherings, and I visited Samy\u00e9 Ling's Holy Island Project (see 3.3.1).With regard to the Wat Dhammapadipa community, I visited the Wat several times, where I spoke mainly to 'monks' and the Thai-Scottish Association. I also included non-ordained Thai people outside the Wat and had email contact to Wat Buddhapadipa in London.  Being  a  member  of  the Dharma  University  society,  I  frequently  met  one particular  Wat  Dhammapadipa  'monk',  who  often  visited  the  society  and  gave instructions about Buddhadharma and meditation.My contact with these Buddhist groups followed a particular scheme: I established  first contact, received instructions on recommended readings and gained information about the local groups. This means that initially I was informed mainly through 'insider literature',  which  consisted  largely  of  leaflets,  newsletters,  magazines  and  internally produced journals. Later, I consulted academic accounts of  the groups, as far as these were available.15 In addition, I  was influenced by two other groups which participate in the public discourse on Buddhism: I took a class on Buddhism at the department of  Asian Studies and became a member of  the Dharma Society, both at the University of  Edinburgh. I also participated in two inter-faith events in Scotland in order to gain an impression of  how Buddhists represent their positions in a wider public sphere. Moreover, I have been influenced by my observations in Buddhist 'temples' in Hong Kong (2006) and Thailand (2007).- 10 -Furthermore,  I  analysed  publicly  accessible  websites  of  the  groups,  since  the internet, following the words of  Oliver Kr\u00fcger (2005:10), \"offers the opportunity to trace [Luckmann's] 'invisible religion'\". This included forums, official websites, intended for self-representation to a wider public,  as well as websites concerned with specific inner-group content.  Lorne Dawson's findings of  human beings who react differently on  the  internet  than  in  their  offline  life  (2004:391)  also  encouraged  me to  analyse personal websites and blogs by some group members. I attempted to gain an impression of  how group teachings were actually perceived and reproduced by long-term members. 'Web 2.0' (i.e. Ajax paradigm oriented) platforms such as YouTube, MySpace or Flickr  also included relevant content. In summary, I  attempted to gain an 'intuitive'  impression of  the groups before I started to analyse them. Even though my analysis is largely based on written, published material,  my  selection  of  information  is  influenced  by  this  'first'  perception  of  the groups. This means that I regard my quotes of  the groups as representative for what I learnt whilst conducting fieldwork with the groups. 1.3.2  Narratives of  identity and discourse analysisAs indicated in 1.2.2, what I found in my research was not Buddhism but the transfer of the  taxon  'Buddhism'  to  essence  (cf.  Sutcliffe  2003:6)  and  the  process  of  identity construction on the level of  both individuals and  organisations. By identity I do not mean the concept of  a fixed, unchanged and continuous entity (cf.  Roseneil/Seymour  1999:3),  but  a  process,  a  \"becoming\"  within  the  activity  of identifying (Jenkins 1996:4), which Madan Sarup (1996:3) summarises as \"the story we tell of  ourselves and which is also the story that others tell of  us.\" But what is this story about? Identity fabrication mainly involves the construction of history as Madan Sarup and Chris Weedon point out:\"[I]t is in the construction of  a narrative, the making and telling of  a story, that we produce the self. The past does not exist except in the sense that we have to interpret past events and, in so doing, create history, identity and ourselves.\" (Sarup 1996:46) This history, of  course, is a particular version of  'the past'; it is the history to which we have access and which thus determines, to a certain extent, our understanding of  the - 11 -present (Weedon 2004:83). By creating a history of  Buddhism, Buddhist groups create their  own  history,  i.e.  their  own  framework  within  which  the  'life'-stories  of  their institutions as well as of  individuals can be located. The creation of  Buddhism as an identity marker is not a new phenomenon. Various studies  have carefully  traced the fabrication of  Buddhist  identity,  for instance,   as  a means of  resistance (e.g. \"Protestant Buddhism\": Gombrich/ Obeyesekere 1988); as a form of  nativism (e.g. Ambedkar: Fitzgerald 2000:124-127); or as a means to strengthen the position of  minorities (e.g. Chinese minorities in Indonesia: Brown 2004). These  cases are remarkable in so far as they are concerned with the construction of  religious  identity;  that  means  that  they  produce  means  to  distinguish  between  groups  and individuals on the basis of  the European export 'religion'. The colonial context certainly is a major force in these examples. For instance, similar re-definitions of  histories of Islam  and  Muslim  identities  took  place  in  the  de-colonialisation  process  of  North African regions (cf. Damir-Geilsdorf  2004:90-94 and Burgat 2003[1996]:24-26).These processes highlight another major element in the construction of  identity: the creation of  'the other' through which one's own identity is conceived (Sarup 1996:47). \"Like the structure of  meaning in language,  identity is relational.  It is  defined in a relation to what it is not. [...] All identities have their 'other' from which they mark their difference.\" (Weedon 2004:19)However, 'the other' is not always present. Weedon reminds us that the creation of  such narratives involves \"exclusion or marginalization of  other possible subject positions and other meanings\" since the product must be a \"singular sense\" of  who we are or where an organisation belongs to (Weedon 2004:61, 19).What is more, as Sarup (1996:18) observed, some narratives become public narratives and may eventually become powerful myths. Even though these myths \u2013 for example, myths of  religious, ethnic or racial identity \u2013 are fictitious, they have 'real' effects on the intersubjectively  experienceable  world  (Weedon  2004:154;  Prentiss  2003:3).  Craig Prentiss (2003:5), drawing on Bruce Lincoln's understanding of  myth, also reminds us that these special forms of  narratives are used to \"authorize [...] their preferences, to justify or re-create their social patterns, or to guide their decision making.\" In this context, the notion of  'discourse' inevitably comes into focus. 'Discourse' in this study denotes \"any system of  interrelated meanings\" as well as the means to socially  - 12 -construct what we perceive as our world (Murphy 2000:399). The idea behind this is that (human) activity, behaviour, references or statements become only meaningful (to other human beings) within a relational framework. Hence, the construction of  Buddhism must be understood as a social activity within such  a  relational  space.  The  framework  within  which  the  activity  of  producing, promoting and utilising knowledge of  an entity called Buddhism takes place determines what can be said and what cannot be said about the respective entity (cf.  Foucault's \"discursive  'police'\";  Foucault  1991[1972]:25).  Reference  points  in  the  discourse  on Buddhism  outline  and  shape  the  repertoire  from  which  various  agents  select  and reproduce certain items. Overall,  a focus on discourse facilitates a perspective which emphasises the 'doing',  the 'producing',  or as Sarup (1996:17) puts it,  the 'how' of  a narrative opposed to the 'what'.However, the application of  discourse theory involves questions about the role of the discourse-producing agent, as noted before with regard to constructionism. Mellor (2004:111),  for  instance, mentions  the  danger  of  regarding  \"human  beings  as remarkably powerless in the face of  arbitrary and abstract discourses\". Certainly, this lack of  addressing agency, inherited from Foucault (Sarup 1996:74-75), is a weakness of discourse theory. Drawing mainly on Roland Barthes, Murphy (2000:401-402) suggests that a solution to the problem might be to perceive the subject itself, including concepts such as 'person' or  the 'I', as contained within the discourse. Such positions (see also Brockmeier/Harr\u00e9 2001:46, 51) all have in common that they weaken the position of  the subject. However, the questions why these terms are thinkable and whether they are produced by neuro-physiological processes (cf. Engler 2004:308), Althusser's Ideological  State Apparatuses (cf. Sarup 1996:53) or social interaction in general (Jenkins 1996:113) remain unresolved.Nonetheless, being aware of  these limitations, discourse analysis provides a powerful heuristic  tool  for  shedding  some light  on  the  immanent  rules  and  reference  points within the stories about Buddhism told by narrators in Scotland.- 13 - 2 The making of  Buddhism(s) 2.1 Buddhism as a colour 2.1.1 A history of  the human colour perception debateBefore I provide a selective overview of  academic responses to the question 'What, if anything, is Buddhism?', I will briefly, and on a simplified level, illustrate a debate which might at  first  glance seem unrelated to 'Buddhism':  the universality  of  colour  name distribution. However, since its argumentative structure resembles that of  the Buddhism discourse, but is less value laden, it may be a helpful metaphor to explore the formation of  Buddhism and 'Buddhism'.In general,  the discourse on human colour  perception encompasses the question whether or not colour naming is  determined by a  universal  process,  i.e.  whether all 'cultures' order the visible wavelengths of  the light spectrum into generally equivalent categories.1 After  Chomskyan criticism of  the  Sapir-Whorf  hypothesis2 of  linguistic relativity, most linguists, psychologists and cognitivists were convinced that the colour labels we assign to particular wavelengths of  light had to be universal. What is more, in the 1960s/70s studies by anthropologists and scientists such as Brent Berlin, Paul Kay or Eleanor Rosch found empirical evidence for universal colour naming.3 In addition, it was  held  that  we  create  so-called  basic  colour  terms  (BCTs)  due  to  the  physical conditions of  our eyes and our brain. These BCTs were found to be equivalent to the English  language  terms  white,  black,  red,  yellow,  green  and  blue  (Lindsey/Brown 2006:16611). All other colour terms were seen as only signifying the shades of  these colours. However, recent findings by scientists such as Jules Davidoff  (2001) and Debi Roberson  et  al.  (2000,  2004)  seem  to  confirm  weak  versions  of  the  Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (e.g. Roberson et al. 2000:391, 2004:555; Davidoff  2001:387) and question  the status quo of  neuro-physiological determinism. Therefore, they propose to comprehend human colour perception as the culturally variant organisation of  the spectrum of  visible wavelengths.4 1 Of  course, the numeral classification of  wavelengths into a spectrum is also a 'cultural' product. In fact, one could argue there is no 'natural' order of  light.2 \"We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. [...]  the world is  presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of  impressions which has to be organized by our minds - and this means largely by the  linguistic  systems  in  our  minds.  We  cut  nature  up,  organize  it  into  concepts,  and  ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way \u2013 an agreement that [...] is codified in the patterns of  our language.\" (Whorf  1956: 213\u2013214) 3 Cf. Davidoff  2001:382; Roberson 2000:1; see also Rosch Heider 1972, especially the case of  'mola'.4 In their empirical study of  Himba and English speakers they argue that the universal process observed \"is a gradual progression from an uncategorized organization of  color based on perceptual similarity - 15 -Illustration 1 shows the World Color Survey (WCS) stimulus array,  which is based on Munsell chips5.  With this grid as our point of  departure, we could ask, for instance, whether we would ascribe the same colour term to cell F4 and F12. Viewers without red-green blindness would probably make use of  different colour names. However, a distribution  of  two  distinct  BCTs  to  F4  and  F40  might  become  more  difficult, dependent on one's organisation of  the colour space. In fact, cultural relativists claim that we have to learn how to order this space of  colours.6 One of  the examples given by cultural relativists are fieldwork findings from non-industrialised 'cultures'  that  clearly  demonstrate immense differences in  colour space organisation,  as  illustrated  by  the  following  two  figures  showing  colour  name distribution by English and Himba speakers.(where  dimensions are  viewed as  continua)  to  a  structured organization of  categories  that  varies across languages and cultures.\" (Roberson et al. 2004:569)5 A set of  chips based on the colour system by Albert H. Munsell. The system specifies a colour by hue, value, and chroma.6 Davidoff  (2001:386)  invokes  a  study  which  shows  that  it  takes  young  children  several  hundred attempts to become able to differentiate between red and green.- 16 -Illustration 4: English naming distribution (Source: Roberson et al. 2004:557)Illustration 3: WCS stimulus array (Source: http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/wcs/data.html)In conclusion,  the relativist claim encompasses the idea that we form our colour terms dependent on our environment and cultural milieu, so that we are more likely to  perceive  differences between certain wavelengths if  we have learnt  particular  colour categories before. Of  course, such claims have been highly contested by universalists. In addition  to  disapproval  of  research  design,  critics  claim  to  have  found  statistical evidence for the clustering of  colour names around focal points within the World Color  Survey (Lindsey/Brown 2006; Regier et al. 2005). However, challenged by Roberson's findings, Paul Kay and Terry Regier (2006:53),  two of  the  main  critics  of  linguistic  relativity,  acknowledge that  to  a  certain  extent \"differences in color naming across languages cause differences in color cognition and/or perception\". They conclude: \"The source of  the universal constraints is not firmly established. However, it appears that it can be said that nature proposes and nurture disposes.\" Therefore, a final scientific agreement is still due. 2.1.2 The colour perception discourse as a metaphor for BuddhismLeaving behind the problems of  electromagnetic radiation, I shall now apply the colour perception  discourse  as  a  metaphorical  framework  for  'Buddhism'. The  premise underpinning  this  metaphor  is  the  idea  that  human  beings  generate  concepts  (e.g. pure/impure,  religious/secular,  sport,  music)  to  distinguish,  organise  and  address particular  spaces  within  the  perceivable  spectrum  of   human  activity.  If  one metaphorically translates the colour perception discourse into 'Buddhism', at least two - 17 -Illustration 5: Himba naming distribution (Source: Roberson et al. 2004:557)  borouseranduvapadumbuzoozumutually exclusive arguments7 appear for the historical establishment of  the category 'Buddhism'. Analogous to the English and Himba colour naming, illustrated above, the binary opposition can be characterised as follows:(1) Universalism (corresponds  mainly  to  essentialist  approaches  in  the  field  of Buddhism/  'Buddhism'):8 the  colour religion (yellow) is a  human  universal. Consequently, Buddhism (dumbu)  signifies religion (yellow)  of  a  'culture' x;  i.e. religion is  translatable.  In other words, Buddhism is a signifier of  that particular human  activity  space  which equals religion in  a  'culturally'  different  context (dumbu = 'the yellow of   Himba speakers').(2) Relativism (corresponds  mainly  to  constructionist  approaches): the  colour religion (yellow) is not a human universal and is therefore not translatable \u2013 but it is   acquirable.  The signifier Buddhism (dumbow9) was  constructed  by  using  a 'culturally'  specific  net  within  the  spectrum of  human  activity  existing  in  a different environment and cultural milieu. Therefore, Buddhism (dumbow) is the product of  the wish to find religion (yellow) within a 'culturally' different human activity spectrum. However, Buddhism only corresponds to this particular space within   one's  own  spectrum,  assigned religion,  since  no  equivalent  exists  in another  spectrum (i.e.  dumbow = just  another concept for yellow,  hence,  \u2260 dumbu).7 See Engler (2004:308-9) for the proposal that these arguments do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.8 I  am referring  here  only  to  those  universalist  and  constructionist  positions  in Religionswissenschaft/ Buddhist  Studies  which  resemble universalism/relativism-patterns  found in  the  colour  perception debate.9 I use the neologism dumbow to signify the space which is postulated to  equal  the  space  of yellow. By contrast, dumbu denotes a specifically Himba language colour space which does not exist in English. This is a very simplified model since one has to bear in mind that the representation of dumbu takes place in a particular situation, for instance, scientific research.- 18 -politicsmusicsportswork leisurepublicprivatelaw  educationreligionIllustration 6: Transfer of  European distinctions onto a fictitious non-European spectrum of  world perception.Scholars  of  category  one  are  concerned  with  capturing  an  object  (Buddhism)  as accurately as possible. They aim to collect all shades of Buddhism and therefore create a first-degree construct (Sch\u00fctz). Their goal is to develop a correct and precise picture of Buddhism. By contrast, scholars belonging to the second category are not interested in whether a particular object exists in 'reality'. Their 'object' is to capture representations  of  or claims about a postulated object; therefore, they aim to provide a second-degree construct ('Buddhism'). Obviously, the two approaches differ epistemologically in their point of  reference: approach one selects and describes phenomena under investigation as forms of  an (ontologised) object. Approach two does not distinguish between the object and statements regarding it; indeed, the object only exists, in terms of  scientific accessibility, in the statements about it.In conclusion, this metaphorical excursus was to illustrate how to imagine what may happen when human beings change space, temporally or geographically, and transfer 'culturally' variant categories from one Lebensraum ('habitat') to another. 'We',10 of  course, still think and classify the new space within our old concepts, 11 which, to us, appear to be 'culturally' invariant.10 'We', e.g., as 17th century colonialists coming to Ceila\u00f5/Ceylon or as 17th century Arabs coming to present-day India or even as 15th century Maya trying to interpret the arrival of  the Conquistadors.11 E.g., the term 'e-mail' is a metaphorical description (electronic movement) of  an older, already familiar concept ('mail') for a new way of  information processing.- 19 - 2.2 Buddhism as a (world) religion 2.2.1 The term and concept 'Buddhism'Many scholars (e.g. Carter 1993:28, Lopez 2005:5-7) have reminded us that the signifier Buddhism and  its  siblings Boudhisme, Buddhismus etc.  have a  history.  In his  remarkable study of  the Victorian discourse on Buddhism, Philip Almond notes:\"Buddhism was 'discovered' in the West during the first half  of  the nineteenth century. It was at this time that the term 'Buddha' ('Buddoo', 'Bouddha', 'Boudhou', etc.) began to  gain  currency  in  the  English-  and  French-speaking  worlds,  and  that  the  term 'Buddhism'  first  made  its  appearance  in  English  in  the  scholarly  journal  which appeared, in part at least, as a consequence of  the developing imperial  interests of both England and France in the Orient.\"(Almond 1988:7)Here,  Almond  identifies  two  major  elements  as  important  for  the  construction  of Buddhism (as well as 'Buddhism'): (1) The \"imperial interests\" of  European powers, or colonialism, and (2) the role of  academia, or as Almond puts it more clearly:  \"Buddhist  scholarship was  not  only  the cause but  also the effect  of  that  which it brought into being - Buddhism.\" (Almond 1988:4)This curative character of  institutionalised academia, being the medium within which scholars such as Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf ([1844]1867) shaped  'Buddhism' in vitro,  cannot be emphasised enough (Lopez 1995a:7-9). The constructors and their product(s), textual in character, noble in essence, and misunderstood by its adherents, have been subject to scrutiny (e.g. King 1999; Almond 1988). However, within this medium the \"discovery\"12 of  Buddhism had its own momentum, whose impact, in- and outside academia, has not yet been fully understood (Masuzawa 2005:143, 316). Nevertheless, two principal mechanisms underpinning the discourse on Buddhism, some still in employment,13 should be emphasised here: a) The superiority of  textual sources  and  a  Max-M\u00fcllerian  approach  of  comparative  linguistics  to  'religions'; 14 b) sheer essentialism as a consequence of  reification, which  John R. Carter  describes as:\"Now that a reified concept, Buddhism, was on the scene authors began to do things with it. It could be put into translations, its essence could be discussed, its quintessence sought,  its  heart  disclosed,  and  its  spirit  made  known.  And  the  quest  for  a  core continued, not always in accord;\"(Carter 1993:29)12 In a private e-mail Philip Almond told me: \"I called it 'discovery' since the notion that it was invented was too tendentious for a book title then.\"13 Cf. Hallisey 1995:49; Lopez1995b:282.14 Cf. Masuzawa 2005: xii, 3, 24, 145.- 20 -This  essentialistic  reification  finally  led from a  descriptive  term,  through a  category (Baird 1971:134) to a (world) religion, which I shall discuss in more detail in 2.2.2 and which Peter Bishop, in his study of  Tibetan Buddhism, summarises as follows:\"For  the  West  to  be  able  even  to  consider  Tibetan  Buddhism as  a  repository  of techniques, it  had to imagined as a system. [...] before this systematization could take place, Buddhism had to be distinguished from Hinduism rather than being viewed as merely a major sect. [...] Buddha-Dharma first became Buddhism, and then Buddhism became a world religion.\"  (emphasis in original)(Bishop 1993:90-91)A representative  result  of  this  essentialism provides  James  Deitrick's  answer  to  his question \"What  is  Buddhism\" (2003:259),  published in  the Routledge Critical  Studies  of  Buddhism series.15 Deitrick's  agenda (2003:265)  behind  his  essentialist  approach is  to criticise 'socially engaged' Buddhist movements and to exclude them from the category 'Buddhism' :\"[W]e might look for that which is 'basic' to Buddhism, some characteristic or set of characteristics that constitutes a necessary, though not necessarily sufficient, condition of  something's being called 'Buddhism.' This would allow us to differentiate between what we might call 'nominal' and 'basic' Buddhism. [...]           [I]t may suffice to locate even one characteristic that is necessary or basic to Buddhism, and  use  it  as  a  minimal  standard  of  comparison  for  judging  whether  engaged Buddhism in Asia ought rightly to be regarded as a novel application of  Buddhist principles to contemporary social problems or a 'heretical' movement that misapplies the term Buddhism to its theories and practices.\" (Deitrick 2003:260)Such a normative approach is not an idiosyncratic contribution to an otherwise critical discipline of  Buddhist Studies. Deitrick's article forms an example of  a larger movement within  Buddhist  Studies,  which  may  be  titled  'Buddhist  Theology'  (Jackson  2000; Freiberger  2004:270-271),  and  his  example  reminds  us  that  behind  each  academic definition lurks a particular agenda. 2.2.2 Buddhism and the world religions paradigm According to scholars such as Tomoko Masuzawa (2005), Timothy Fitzgerald (1990:101, 2000),  Hans  Kippenberg  (2003:42-48)  or  Donald  Lopez  (2005),  the  formation  of 'Buddhism' has to be understood within a wider picture:  the construction of  'world 15 For another example see Green 1989:275.- 21 -religions' during European colonialism. In fact, this process, which also contributed to the  creation  of Religionswissenschaft,  is  identified by  Maszuawa in The invention of  world  religions as:\"[...] a particular discursive practice, namely, 'world religions' as a category and as a conceptual  framework  initially  developed  in  the  European  academy,  which  quickly became an effective means of  differentiating, variegating, consolidating, and totalizing a large portion of  the social,  cultural,  and political  practices observable among the inhabitants of  regions elsewhere in the world.\"(Masuzawa 2005:20)Indeed, once 'religion' had been separated from Christianity, a process which began in the  15th  century   (Gladigow 2006:\u00a76-7)  and which  brought  about  a  redefinition  of \"religiones falsae\" as opposed to \"religio vera\" (Christendom), at least the elites of  European Christianities saw themselves confronted with the new product of  their own thinking patterns:  the  \"other  'great  religions'  of  the  world\"  (Masuzawa 2005:18).  Within this logic,  European  institutions  of  knowledge  had  to  (re-)organise  the  newly  gathered colonial data.Furthermore, this logic was also constrained by the manner in which human beings, and  probably  other  primates  (cf.  Vonk  et  al.  2004),  learn:  from the  known to  the unknown, finding subcategories to main categories (cf. Nguyen 2007). With regard to the representation of  what Europeans imagined as 'religions', Lopez offers a description of  this extension of  subcategories: \"In  the  seventeenth  century,  only  four  religions  were  identified  in  the  world: Christianity, Judaism, Islam (generally called Mohammedism or some variant of  the term), and Paganism (also known as Idolatry). The history of  the academic study of religion is in one sense a process of  replacing Paganism with a larger lists of  isms: Hinduism, Confucianism, Daoism, Shintoism, Sikhism, and, of  course, Buddhism.\"(Lopez 2005:5)This logic had different products. On the one hand, colonial powers responded to the confrontation with these 'objects' with events such as the World's Parliament of  Religions in Chicago. A similar strategy and further predecessor of  inter-religious dialogue can be exemplified by the work of  Rudolf  Otto, founder of  the Religi\u00f6ser Menschheitsbund, who developed the  model  of  \"das  Heilige\"  (Otto 1917) as  a  shared fundamentum of  the human behaviour he identified as religious on his numerous journeys outside Europe. On the other hand, a new list of  world religions emerged (Masuzawa 2005:44-46), whose different  items have been examined by various  scholars:  for  instance,  Harjot - 22 -Oberoi (1997) dealt  with the construction of  Sikhism, Eric Frykenberg (1993, 2000) discussed the concept of  Hinduism, and Rosalind Shaw (1990) investigated the category of  \"African traditional religions\".16Even though most of  these categories  have been disputed on the basis  of  their essentialist character (Baird 1971:134), or what Masuzawa calls \"comparative theology\", they are still widely used (Masuzawa 2005:22-23). Certainly, Morny Joy's plea (2001:177-179)  to  critically  address \"the  'Eurocentric  mindset'  and  [...]  philosophic  and methodological  presuppositions\"  of Religionswissenschaft,  stimulated  by  works  such  as Said's Orientalism (1978), is still legitimate.In summary, the general line of  argument found in the above, more or less post-oriental  and  postcolonial,  accounts  can  be  characterised  as  follows:  Europeans encountered other regions of  the world of  which they had no previous knowledge. The  'new'  knowledge  gained  was  bound  within  the  categories  they  had  developed  and brought from Europe. One of  these categories was 'religion' which was expressed in the 'religion of x' rhetoric. Hence, structurally similar to the interpretatio graeca or interpretatio  romana17, colonialists from present-day western Europe created 'Buddhism' through their 'interpretatio colonica'. 2.2.3 Criticisms of  the post-oriental approachPost-oriental  approaches  and  postcolonial  critique  have  themselves  not  remained uncriticised and various scholars have attempted to defend contested categories.  For instance, like 'Buddhism' the concept 'Hinduism' has been subject to critical evaluation.  However, David Lorenzen refutes what he conceives of  as the outcome of  postcolonial  analysis of  Hinduism:1816 Shaw (1990:342) writes: \"The invention of  'African Traditional Religion' [...] is partly a function of this wider invention of  such residual categories as 'traditional religions' within 'traditional' religious studies.\" 17 By interpretatio graeca and interpretatio romana I refer to the activity of  ancient Greek and Roman writers to identify gods of  subjected societies with gods of  their own pantheon (e.g. Egyptian gods or Celtic and Germanic gods, respectively).18 David  Gellner  (2004:368)  uses  Lorenzen's  article  as  an  authority:  \"In  this  context  the  idea  that Hinduism is entirely a colonial construction, the bastard child of  western orientalist scholarship and misguided Indian nationalists,  is  extremely attractive to left-leaning intellectuals.  Unfortunately this theory is false, as has been shown in an important essay by David N. Lorenzen [...].\"- 23 -\"Hinduism wasn't  invented  sometime after  1800,  or  even  around the  time  of  the establishment of  the Delhi Sultanate. What did happen during the centuries of  rule by dynasties of  Muslim sultans and emperors was that Hindus developed a consciousness o f a  shared  religious  identity  based  on  the  loose  family  resemblance  among  the variegated beliefs and practices of  Hindus, whatever their sect, caste, chosen deity, or theological school.\"(Lorenzen 1999:655)\"Although the religion of  [the early] Puranas displays many continuities with the earlier Vedic religion, its principal features and emphases\u2014particularly its greatly expanded mythology of  the gods Vishnu, Siva and Devi\u2014do, I think, justify marking this religion off  as  something  new,  as the  beginning  of  medieval  and modern Hinduism.  This Hinduism wasn\u2019t invented by anyone, European or Indian. Like Topsy, it just grow\u2019d\".(Lorenzen 2000:655)Scholars such as Lorenzen plead to maintain the category 'Hinduism' by blending out its meta-level discourse. Lorenzen stresses the (discovered) object which, he assumes, must have been there before the heterogeneous colonial powers arrived. A structurally similar  argument  can  be  found  in  Jonathan  Silk's  critique  of  Almond's British  discovery  of  Buddhism: \"There must be a Buddhism which some people and some works of  scholarship are able to reflect more accurately, honestly and directly than others. [...] If  it is assumed that 'the construction and interpretation of  Buddhism reveals much about nineteenth-century  concerns,'  then it  is  necessarily  true that  'Buddhism'  exists  outside of  and independent of  those nineteenth-century concerns,  through the lens of  which it  is interpreted.\" (Silk 1994:173-174)Neither  Lorenzen  nor  Silk  agree  with  the  counter-intuitive  critique  of  essentialist category formation (cf. Baird 1971:134-141). For them, an object must be out there. Similar  to  the  nature/nurture-dichotomy  found  in  the  discourse  on  human  colour perception, Silk stresses the existence of  objective constraints: \"There are better and worse descriptions of  an object  because,  however ultimately unknowable in its essence, there is an object which by its presence restricts what can be said  about  it.  No matter  how unknowable  the Buddha,  some statements are  more plausible than others.\"(Silk 1994:183)One might ask: more plausible to whom? Silk does not refer to any criteria but to the restriction of  \"presence\". Without further developing his essence/presence-dichotomy, he suggests a pragmatic essentialism instead:- 24 -\"[E]ven if  we aim at understanding how the enlightened Buddha was understood by others [...] it is necessary to post an essentialist basis without which we cannot evaluate any argument.\"(Silk 1994:183)Since  Silk  is  concerned  with  the  (non-subjective)  reality  of  an  object, he  does  not discuss object representation. However, drawing on James Cox' outline for a scientific study  of  human  activity  (2006:236-238), it  is  solely  the  representational  level  of  a (postulated) non-falsifiable (alternate) reality of  an object which is accessible to scientific methods \u2013 be it love, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or a Buddha \u2013 which is why the degree of  trust and belief  that we lay upon its representation(s) needs to be addressed.A  further  criticism  is  delivered  by  Will  Sweetman,  who  is  concerned  with representations of  Hinduism. Sweetman (2004:31-32) argues that Orientalist impact on India  can  only  be  evaluated  by  a  (still  non-existent)  \"pre-history  of  Orientalism\" (2004:16). Sweetman also rejects the critique of  researching Hinduism as a 'religion', as proposed, for instance, by Fitzgerald (1990). He argues that such criticisms are based on a protestant, pre-modern understanding of  the term 'religion' :\"That the modern academic concept of  religion emerged in the West does not by itself mean that the concept is inapplicable in other cultures, any more than it means that religion did not exist in the West prior to the articulation of  the modern sense of religion.\"(Sweetman 2003:351)Furthermore,  since  'religion'  as  an  abstraction  can  never  be  clearly  demarcated (Sweetman  2003:348),  he  disproves  of  Fitzgerald  (2000:149),  who  questions  the analytical usefulness of   'religion' in an Indian context. Therefore, Sweetman criticises the practice of  dissociating oneself  from categories such as Hinduism. He holds that such categories only reflect abstract selections as \"one of  a number of  possible ways of cutting  across  the  available  data\"  (2003:350)  and  proposes  to  ask:   \"How far  is  it profitable to analyse Hinduism as a religion?\" He concludes (p351) that there is \"no reason to abandon the terms 'religion' and 'Hinduism' if  used in a reflexive way.Whereas Sweetman's thoughts regarding available pre-19th century data are certainly correct,19 his further points encompass at least two problems: 19 However, Sweetman does not address the general problem of  historiography, which does no deal with history as such but with memories.- 25 -(1) He assumes a \"modern academic concept of  religion\", which is not protestant but applicable to non-Western contexts (Sweetman 2003:341, 351). However, he fails to include a reference to this concept and thus creates the illusion that there  exists a consensus within academia about what constitutes 'religion'.(2) Sweetman states that any abstract category has limitations but must be accessed by  its  profitability.  However,  he  seems  to  ignore  that  Fitzgerald's  work demonstrates  that  some  concepts  are  more  useful  than  others.  By  contrast, Sweetman does not provide a single example where the concept of  'Hinduism as a religion' has actually been illuminating; in fact, his argumentation neglects to discuss the relationship between the concept and its signifier. In other words: analysing Hinduism as an apple, is certainly legitimate; nonetheless, one must reveal  one's  agenda  for  doing  so.  Sweetman  argues  for  such  an  awareness;  however,  he  does  not  provide  evidence  for  this  reflexive  practice  to  be  a common  academic  standard  in Religionswissenschaft,  nor  is  he  successful  at offering an example which would actually prove the concerns of  most writers against 'Hinduism' or 'religion' wrong.Of  course, the range of  criticism of  post-oriental and postcolonial works is much more diverse  than  my  selective  compilation  above  would  suggest.  For  instance,  other criticisms encompass the critique of  the (sometimes) postmodern basis of  post-oriental accounts and a defence of  history-of-ideas approaches (e.g. Gombrich 2003).20 What is more, Philip Mellor, in his critique of  Said's Orientalism warns against the danger to reify 'the West' (2004:104) and to replace human consciousness by Foucauldian \"arbitrary and abstract discourses\" (p111).Other  scholars  question  the  overall  hermeneutic  framework  resulting  from postcolonial critique. According to Thomas Lawson and Robert McCauley (1993), the 'hermeneutic  turn',  which  was  thought  to  protect  postcolonial  scholarship  against 20 Richard Gombrich (2003:14) argues for a historicist approach in regard to Buddhism: \"Firstly,  we acquire more understanding of  someone who must have had one of  the most brilliant and interesting minds in the whole of  human history. If  it is \u00e9litist to be more interested in his thought than in the  thought of  any person the anthropologist meets in the street, or even in the local monastery, I am happy to be an \u00e9litist. Secondly, by seeing how original meanings have been lost and changed, we are able  to  give  Buddhism  a  history -  and  thus  incidentally  to  corroborate  the  Buddha's  claim  that  all compounded things are impermanent.\" (emphasise added)- 26 -colonial explanation of  'cultures',  actually  facilitates  two  other  'evils': \"hermeneutic exclusivism\" plus the hermeneutic circle (p218, p203) and the textualisation of  'cultures'  (p215), which again may provide a basis for cultural imperialism. 2.2.4 A plea for post-oriental approaches to 'Buddhism'Simply put, scholars informed by post-oriental and postcolonial theory often stress the imaginative and discursive side of  category formation. Some of  their critics understand this as a claim that these 'objects' were created ex nihilo (e.g. Silk 1994:175) and therefore request  for  a  more  balanced historiography,  which also includes  the  involvement  of non-western  agents  (e.g.  Bell  2000:5-6). Here,  Hans  Kippenberg  and  Kocku  von Stuckrad offer a solution for both parties,  which they see in the distinction between invention and construction: \"Something cannot be reiterated enough in this context: The construction of  history is not the same as the invention of  history; relativity means mutual relationship but not arbitrariness.\"21(Kippenberg/von Stuckrad 2003:41)Kippenberg's and von Stuckrad's \"relativity\" is based on Charles Hallisey's concept of \"intercultural mimesis\". This concept aims to include the role of  the 'alleged victims' or to stress, as Richard King (1999:148) summarises it, \"[the] intercultural interchange that occurs between the native and the Orientalist in the construction of  Western knowledge about 'the Orient'\". Scholars often refer to intercultural mimesis in order to either refute post-oriental  and  post-colonial  critique  (see  Monius  2006)  or  to  nuance  European encounters  with  non-European  societies  between  the  15th  until  early  20th  century, exhibited, for example, by King:\"It  is  important  to  reiterate  [...]  the  role  played  by  Asian  Buddhists  and  specific Buddhist  texts in the modern construction of  Buddhism. [...]  Asian Buddhists and their sacred literature [...] contributed to Orientalist representations of  'Buddhism'. It is in  this  sense  that  we  should  see  the  construction  of  Orientalist  notions  such  as 'Buddhism' or 'Hinduism' as the product of  a process of  intercultural mimesis.\" (King 1999:149)21 \"Eines kann in diesem Zusammenhang nicht oft genug wiederholt werden: Das Konstruieren von Geschichte ist nicht dasselbe wie das Ausdenken von Geschichte, Relativit\u00e4t bedeutet gegenseitige Bezogenheit und nicht Beliebigkeit.\"- 27 -However,  Hallisey's  approach  to  tackle  \"latent  Orientalism\"  (1995:31)  should  be understood, as Hallisay himself  proposes, as \"no more than suggestive\" (p49). Indeed, it  becomes clear that \"intercultural mimesis\" contextualises the imperial business rather than questioning the overall theoretical framework of  postcolonial critique: (1) Hallisey's argumentation is based upon the myth of  Thailand's independence. Since Thailand has never officially been a European colony (p48-49), Hallisey assumes  Thailand's  Buddhist  \"reformation\" processes (p49),  which resembled sangha changes in British and French colonies in South East Asia, to be without  colonial influence. However, Hallisey does not discuss the 'native' circumstances which caused Rama I. and Rama IV., and their successors, to feel in the need for changing the 'Siamese' sangha.22 (2) Hallisey furthermore emphasises the role of  Lankese bhikkhus, who supported Orientalists  such  as  Rhys  Davids  and  influenced  the  representation  of Buddhism  (p47).  However,  he  does  not  further  discuss  the  \"Protestant Buddhism\" milieu (Gombrich/Obeyesekere 1988) in which these bhikkhus were operating.  Moreover,  what  Hallisey  suggests  as  the  actual  mimesis,   i.e.  to \"imitat[e] traditional Buddhist pedagogical patterns [...] [and to] us[e] vernacular commentarial  literature  as  an  aid  and  guide  to  the  meanings  of  the  more authoritative  canonical  texts\" (p43),  was  still  determined  by  at  least  two specifically  European-colonial  approaches:  the  textuality  of  sources  and  the selection  of  people  perceived  by  colonialists  as  religious  specialists  (cf.  Blackburn 2001:17;  Veidlinger 2006:9).22 In regard to changes in 19th century Therav\u0101da, Hallisey claims that \"the Thai developments were clearly not determined by the presence of  antagonistic Westerners\" which is why \"we should avoid attributing too much force to the 'West'  (or Christianity, or Protestant assumptions, or Orientalism)\". He bases this claim on Reynolds 1976 and Keyes 1989. An evaluation of  these authors, however, give a  different  impression  than  Hallisey's  argument  would  suggest  in  the  first  place: \"These  two circumstances\u2013the  presence  of  Westerners  willing  to  discuss  comparative  culture,  and  a  reform monastic order critical of  monastic culture\u2013combined to force on more and more Siamese a new awareness of  themselves and their past.\" (Reynolds 1976:212)Furthermore, Hallisey quotes Keyes (1989:124, 126) as support to his own thesis but neglects that Keyes (124-125) indicates the (British influenced) 'Protestant Buddhism' environment within which Rama  IV.  developed  his  influential  ideas  about  a  reformed  sangha.  Keyes  (p124)  also  refers  to Burmese and Siamese warfare that led to the 'subtle revolution' of  Rama I. Pamaree (2006:8,23) sheds some light on the Burmese and Siamese relations, which cannot be understood without bearing in mind the presence of  European powers (incl. weapon trade) at that time.- 28 -In  this  context,  European  colonialism  becomes,  at  best,  a  'selection  pressure'23 on conquered regions. Thus, we need to investigate how this selection pressure facilitated the speaking about Buddhism (and of  course 'Buddhism'). Stephen Prothero's (1996) analysis of  Henry Steel  Olcott,  provides a basis for such examinations.  Drawing on linguistic theory of  creolisation, Prothero (1996:8) describes Olcott's Buddhism as \"a 'creolization' of  the [American] Protestantism of  his youth and the Buddhism of  his adulthood.\"  With  reference  to  linguistic  terminology,  Prothero  emphasises  the  rules underpinning Olcott's actions:\"While the lexicon of  his faith was almost entirely Buddhist, its grammar was largely Protestant. If  you think of  the religious beliefs and behaviors of  Olcott as a form of discourse,  it  will  become apparent  that  at  the more superficial  lexical  level,  Olcott echoed his Asian Buddhist acquaintances both in words and in actions. [...] But at the more enduring grammatical  level  of  deep structural  and unconscious  assumptions, Olcott remained an American Protestant.\"(Prothero 1996:9)Employing Prothero's analysis of  Olcott, we may describe these processes of  'cultural contact' as 'powers of  standardisation' that set up a 'grammar' of  how to communicate an object  of  concern.  But  who established these  rules?  What  was  the  logic  behind particular agendas? Qui bono? These questions are important for the study of  any agents or interest groups which were then present in these regions - whether it be people from  the British Isles, Lan Na or the Kandyan kingdom.To conclude: In any legitimate critique of  postcolonial theory we should not neglect the technological, ideological and economic reasons for why people from present-day  Europe  arrived,  administered  and  fought  in  regions  they  called  'the  Orient'  \u2013  as  Fitzgerald reminds us in his examination of  the religious/secular-dichotomy in Japan:\"The idea that there are some special phenomena in all societies that can be described as religious or religions was [...] an idea received from the west, or at least negotiated into existence by local [e]lites with the help of  trading enterprises, military officers, Christian missionaries,  colonial  administrators and others.  [...]  In most cultures that became colonised, what we call law, economics, and politics were not separated out into distinct spheres but were embedded in a different indigenous way of  representing the world. It was this disembedding that was a necessary programme for the imperial power if  it  was  to  impose western-style  laws,  create  capital  markets  and forms of exchange, and to 'educate' the people in the new school systems.\"(Fitzgerald 2003)23 My metaphorical  use of  the evolutionary biology term 'selection pressure'  refers  to  the idea that external forces on a system may press the development of  the given system into a particular direction. This means that certain groups and individuals, ideas and concepts are privileged over others.- 29 - 2.3 Buddhism(s) in 'the West' 2.3.1 The rhetoric of  Buddhism in the WestIn an increasing number of  contemporary academic introductions to Buddhism, readers find  themselves  confronted  with  at  least  one  chapter  on  \"Buddhism  in  the  West\"  (Gethin 1998, Keown 2000), \"Buddhism beyond Asia\" (Harvey 1990) or  \"Buddhism comes West\" (Robinson 2005:292). These chapters, often presented in the last part of such introductory books, are based on the assumption that different religious traditions which have been grouped as Buddhism or \"Buddhist religions\" (Robinson 2005) can (now) also be found in areas of  the world which have become known as 'the West'. Indeed, all of  these categories raise classificatory problems in regard to 19th century definitions in a 21st century world: Does a Sinhalese Buddhist community in Stockholm constitute Buddhism in the West? Is an Italian backpacker in Kathmandu, who strictly follows  her  Lama  and  speaks  Tibetan  fluently,  a  Western  Buddhist?  Is  she  more 'western' than her Japanese friend who accompanies her? Are Dalit Buddhists in the TBMSG24 Western Buddhists?  Should we redefine  all  these  categories  each time we choose a new group of  people to be object of  our research? What then constitutes the group under investigation? Often,  chapters  on  \"Buddhism in  the  West\"  are  not  simply  ignorant  of  Saidian critique. Even though notions of  \"Buddhism in the West\" to some extent incorporate the presupposition that Buddhism is rooted in a part of  the world considered as 'the East', the motivation for this distinction is different. In contrast to \"Islam in the West\", which  is  often  paired  with  notions  of  migration  and  violence  (cf.  Almond  2004), \"Buddhism in  the  West\"  is  seen  as  the  emergence  of  groups  which  predominately recruit  \"Caucasian  middle-class  people\",  often  described  as  \"convert\",  \"white\"  or \"western\" Buddhists, who adapt, translate and cultivate the Buddha's teachings.25 Such narratives  mostly  start  with  'Westerners'  who  went  to  'the  East'  in  order  to  'learn'  Buddhism. Once they returned, these Euro-Americans established \"Buddhism in the West\",  which  will,  according  to  Prebish  and Baumann (2002:4),  \"in  the  twenty-first century  [develop]  independent  Western  forms  and  schools  of  Buddhism.\"  Such 24 Trailokya Bauddha Mahasangha Gana, est. 1964 by Sangharakshita; now the Indian wing of  the FWBO.25 Cf. Prebish 2002:2-3; For a definition of  terms such as \"convert\", \"white\", or \"cradle\" Buddhists see Tweed 2002 and Bluck 2006:16.- 30 -interpretations can also be found in variations which adopt nation-state concepts and result  in  terms such as  \"British  Buddhism\" (Bluck  2006),  \"Brazilian  Buddhism\" (da Rocha 2001), \"American Buddhism\" (Prebish/ Tanaka 1998) etc. The overall question often underpinning such approaches can be exemplified by Robert Bluck:\"[H]as Buddhism in Britain merely copied the original Asian traditions, or are we able to see new developments, new seeds or shoots that may be growing into distinctive forms of  'British Buddhism'?\"(Bluck 2006:2)Within the Buddhism-in-the-West narrative, groups with a migration background, which called  themselves  Buddhist,  have  long  been  neglected.  What  is  more,  the  relatively recent consideration of  these groups led to tensions within the academic discourse on Buddhism  and  is  reflected  in  the  \"two  Buddhisms\"  thesis.26 This  notion  became necessary to handle the structurally very different phenomena of  'convert' and so-called 'ethnic'27 Buddhism since both groups were to be subsumed under the same umbrella term, 'Buddhism'. 2.3.2 The 'Buddhism is like a tomato' paradigmAcademic encounters, which use the concept 'Buddhism in the West', or even 'Western Buddhism',  are  often  based  upon a  particular  academic  paradigm.  The  general  idea postulated by this paradigm is that Buddhism originated in India, spread to different countries, adapted to different cultures and obtained new shapes (see, e.g., Bluck2006 :1; Prebish/Baumann 2002:2, 6-7). It is an essentialist model that distinguishes Buddhism from 'culture'. Hence, especially in its strong version, it is concerned with Buddhism per se rather than with people, who consequently are seen as merely 'containers'  of  this reified Buddhism.With reference to a debate between Martin Baumann and Eva Neumaier-Dargyay in the 1990s (Baumann 1994, 1996; Neumaier-Dargyay 1995), I shall call this model the \"Buddhism  is  like  a  tomato\"  paradigm.28 Baumann's   intention  in  his  article  \"The 26 Cf. Numrich 2003:58-59 based on Prebish 1993:189; the thesis claims that there are two Buddhisms: one  practised  by  \"ethnic  Asian-American  Buddhist  groups\"  and  one  of  \"mostly  members  of European-derived ancestry\".27 By 'ethnic' Buddhism scholars mean those people whose ancestors or who themselves have come from countries which are described, in public discourse, as both Asian and Buddhist.28 For a similar metaphor, using pumpkin seeds, see Numrich 1996:3.- 31 -transplantation of  Buddhism to Germany\" (1994:35) is to \"outlin[e] several processive modes which occur while geographically transplanting a religious tradition.\" Building upon  Hubert  Seiwert,  he  anchors  the  object  of  transplantation,  \"Buddhdharma\" (1994:38),  only  to  those  \"(symbolic)  systems\" (1996:367)  that  refer  to  the  figure  of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha, i.e. to \"the common doctrinal foundation of  Buddhist religion\" and the  \"final  source  of referential authority, which is the word of  the Buddha (Sanskrit buddavacana) \" (1994:37).  Baumann  then  explores  five  modes  of  transplantation  (e.g. \"contact\", \"ambiguity and adaptation\") and six strategies of  adaptation (e.g. \"translation\" and \"assimilation\"). Since his theoretical framework is embedded into the metaphor of transplantation, Baumann works with terms such as \"home tradition\", \"host culture\" and  \"imported  religious  tradition\"  (1994:44,  52)  and  neglects  the  agents'  agendas involved. Dismissing this model as too simplistic, Eva Neumaier-Dargyay (1995:187) stresses in  her  critique  of  Baumman  that  \"[o]ne  needs  to  question  whether  the  forms  of Buddhism that arrived in Germany were identical with those the religion exhibited in its  mother countries.\" Furthermore, she explains that \"the 'imported' religion is already in an  altered  state  before  it  ever  gets  appropriated  by  the  host  culture\"  (1995:188). Naumaier-Dargyay  admits  that  \"[t]he  idea  that  symbolic  systems  of  culture  can  be moved and transplanted like plants or other material things is enticing.\" But condensing her  critique into  the  overall  question  \"Is  Buddhism like  a  tomato?\"  (1995:186),  she emphasises that such a metaphorical  framework \"packages complex processes rather neatly\" (1995:187). 2.3.3 Buddhism as a socio-regional phenomenonWhat  are  the  alternatives  to  metaphors  of  transplantation  for  discussing  such phenomena  grouped  as  'Buddhism  in  the  West'?  If  things  are  so  complex  and complicated,  how  can  we  understand  what  Prebish  (2002:4)  calls  \"processes  of settlement  and  growth\"  in  a  different  way? Perhaps,  a  solution might  be  to further develop  and  improve  our  terminology  in  regard  to  \"transplantation\"  of  religious traditions (Baumann 1996:371).  However,  I  consider a native/foreign-dichotomy and - 32 -other metaphors of  transplantation,  which obscure the object  of  transplantation,  as  unhelpful starting points for any historical approach other than Ideengeschichte ('history of ideas'). Since they smuggle in an underpinning premise of  historical continuity of  (a  particular)  tradition,  they  hinder  the  examination  of  historical  events  from  any perspective other than this one particular thread. Therefore, I would like to suggest a threefold  grid  of  'least  common  denominators';  a  phenomenon  which  may  be summarised as 'Buddhism' production in contemporary Scotland:(1) Individual  level: The  results  of statistical  surveys  (e.g.  the  2001  Census) confront us with a growing number of  people who tick \"Buddhist\" to questions concerned  with  religious  identity.  Here,  two  simple  factors  mesh  with  each other: First, Scottish residents have learnt to identify themselves as \"Buddhists\". Second,  government executives decided both to ask for religious identity and to offer \"Buddhist\" as an option to be ticked.29(2) Institutional level: There is  a  growth in institutionalised groups,  labelled as \"Buddhist\",   whose membership is based on and defined in terms of  \"being Buddhist\".  Such  developments,  taking  place  in  Scotland,  have  not  been historically recorded prior to the 19th century. Typically, these groups are not geographically bound to nation-states and act on economic and humanitarian levels as well as on the political scene.(3) Migratory  level: People who, for various reasons, migrate from one part of Eurasia  (e.g.  political  Vietnam)  to  another  which  may  be  thousands  of kilometres  away  (e.g.  political  France).  When  they  arrive  at  their  new environment,  they  will  be  placed  within  local  prevalent  discourses  of  social classifications and categories. Within these prevalent discourses, elements of  the migrant's behaviour may be classified as 'Buddhist'  and thus become a direct reference point in local narratives about Buddhism. 29 Cf.  Scottish  Executive 2005:66;  Even though 'Jediism'  was not  listed in  the census questionnaire, 0.227% identified as \"Jedi\" under the rubric of  '\"Another religion\" (compare to Buddhists: 0.13%). One must therefore consider the context and forces behind the actual items to choose from: \"None, Church of  Scotland,  Roman Catholic,  Other  Christian (please write  in),  Buddhist,  Hindu,  Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Another Religion (please write in).\" (2005:66). In comparison, during the Nazi regime,  German Buddhists in the Wehrmacht could only choose between 'catholic', 'protestant', 'protestant sect' and  'Gotterkenntnis  nach  Mathilde  Ludendorff'  ('god  realisation  according  to  Mathilde  Ludendorff') (Baumann 1995b:106-107).- 33 -If  migrants themselves have been 'exposed' to discourses about Buddhism in the regions of  their 'first-place' socialisation, for instance, nationalist discourses in Lanka or social reform identity discourses created by Ambedkar Buddhism in India  since  1957,  they  may  communicate  these  narratives  in  their  new environment, which \u2013 under certain circumstances \u2013 might than be reproduced by local elites (e.g. political agents, academics, media producers).For the reasons illustrated above, I understand the Buddhism-in-the-West narrative as an origin myth, which fulfils specific tasks in the process of  constructing Buddhist identity.  That is, (1) to provide a sense of  historical security as well as authenticity and (2) to prophetically draft a future framework for some contemporary Buddhist movements \u2013 both in the light of  an anachronistic (re-)construction of  socio-political developments in Asian societies within a period of  2,500 years.In doing so, this myth resembles narratives which locate a contemporary time period within a spectrum of past time epochs which themselves have been constructed out of  a contemporary analysis  and subsequent  systematisation of  the  past.  For  the  purpose  of clarification  I  shall  also  emphasise  that  the  origin  myth  encoded in  the  rhetoric  of 'Buddhism in  the  West'  is  to  be  differentiated  from:  (1)  the  public  (and  scholarly)  discourse on Buddhism in Euro-American parts of  the world (i.e. 'Buddhism' in 'the West') and (2) the sociology of   Buddhist groups in these localities (Buddhist groups in 'the West').Thus, the rhetoric of  'Buddhism in the West' may also be understood as an element of  'Buddhist theology'30, which does not have any explanatory power within a historio-critical analysis from a Religionswissenschaft point of  view. Nevertheless, employing Cox, the origin myth of   'Buddhism in the West' becomes a field of  study:\"Scholars of  religion do not study alternate realities themselves, since these cannot be studied, but they analyse what is postulated about that which is non-falsifiable and in what way this affects the communities which do the postulating.\"31(Cox 2006:237)30 See 'Buddhist theologian' Alan Wallace (2000:74): \"[T]he modern historical study of  Buddhism might help Buddhists by demonstrating the adaptability of  their own tradition as it has transformed from one culture and historical era to another. Such knowledge could help Buddhists maintain the vitality of their tradition in today's world, rather than adhering dogmatically to the forms Buddhism developed in other cultures and historical eras.\"31 The postulation of  a continued transmission of  the Buddha's dharma from his context into 'western' countries is  indeed non-falsifiable;  so are postulations about the Buddha's existence as well  as his enlightenment, statements about nirvana, etc.- 34 -For an approach that abandons metaphors of  transplantation, based on assumptions about 'non-falsifiable continuities',  one could turn to Hans Kippenberg (1995),  who argues for an approach termed lokale Religionsgeschichte, i.e. the regional historiography of religion(s), which also takes into account the concrete, everyday life-world of  a region's inhabitants (1995:16). By this, he means an approach which overcomes the discrepancy between data gained from 'religio-historical'32 and social scientific analyses of  religion(s). According to Kippenberg, it is elementary for a lokale Religionsgeschichte focus to establish a  balance between interpreting human activity  through the template of  authoritative scriptures alone and the total neglect of  such scriptures as \"detached theology which is practically  more  or  less  without  consequences\"33 (1995:14).  However,  Edith  Franke (2005b:17)  emphasises  that  Kippenberg  is  still  too  centred  on scriptures  and  warns against the danger of  classifying religions into 'institutionalised (high culture) religions'  (Hochreligionen),  'folk  religions'  (Volksreligionen)  and  'pseudo-religions'  (Pseudoreligionen). Therefore, she states that all different levels of  religious phenomena have to be analysed with the same priority.In  reference  to  the  spatially  constraining  focus  of lokale  Religionsgeschichte,  Hubert Seiwert (1995:146) summarises the approach as follows:\"The concentration on graspable geographical spaces allows us to perceive religion as an element of  our everyday life-world (Lebenswelt).Thereby, it becomes clear that social reality  often  corresponds  only  to  a  restricted  extent  to  the  image  imparted  by authoritative sources.\"34What is more, Seiwert (1995:153-154) notes the different outcome of  a localised, regio-historical approach, which he adopts for his study of  South Chinese coast regions, in contrast to mere Ideengeschichte:\"On the basis of  research anchored to regional historiography we can realise, however, that  the  image  imparted  by  official  sources  is  in  many  ways  distorted.  The  sharp distinction  between  Buddhism,  Daoism,  and  Confucianism  is  the  product  of  an examination  predominantly  based on  a  focus  on  the  history  of  literature.  For  the largest part of  the population, including the local elites, this distinction had no or only a minor impact on their religious practice.\"32 Kippenberg means the pre-1990s predominant history-of-literature approach to the study of  religions.33 \"[...] abgehobene, praktisch mehr oder weniger folgenlose Theologie.\"34 \"Die Konzentration auf  \u00fcberschaubare geographische R\u00e4ume erlaubt es, Religion als Bestandteil der allt\u00e4glichen Lebenswelt wahrzunehmen. Dabei wird deutlich, da\u00df die soziale Realit\u00e4t oft nur in sehr eingeschr\u00e4nktem Ma\u00dfe dem Bild entspricht, das die autoritativen Quellen vermitteln.\"- 35 -\"Research in the area of  lokale Religiongeschichte allows us, indeed it forces us, to take into consideration concrete, spatially and temporarily specified events and processes. In our sources, we do not encounter 'Buddhism' ('der Buddhismus'), but a particular ritual or a specific institution at a determinable place and a determinable time.\" (emphasis added)(Seiwert 1995:154)Therefore,  similar  to  Franke  (2005b:15),  who  maintains  that  studies  of  religion(s)  without a regional focus result in \"inappropriate generalisations which cannot withstand empirical  verification\",  Seiwert  proposes  an  anthropological  focus  for  the  study  of religions (1995:155):\"We  are  confronted  with  human  actions  and  the  products  of  human  actions  - including interpretations of  the world as well as social institutions and material objects. It is our own scholarly interpretation in the first place which classifies the empirical reality into categories such as economics, politics or religion. Religion and religions are not empirical objects but categories of  our thinking.\"It  is  this  non-essentialist  and non-generalising framework which,  to my mind,  make lokale Religionsgeschichte an important applicable focus to be used in the study of  religions.  Thus,  in  the  context  of lokale  Religionsgeschichte,  Scotland,  as a geo-political  boundary, certainly provides an adequate and geographically graspable environment for studying the production of  the discourse on Buddhism as one element among others within the history of  religion(s) in Scotland (Schottische Religionsgeschichte).- 36 - 3 The construction of  'Buddhism': case studies 3.1 Contextualising Buddhist groups in Scotland 3.1.1 An extract of  historical notions of  Buddhist activityThe  attempt  to  produce  a  historiography  of  Buddhist  groups  and  the  making  of 'Buddhism' in Scotland poses major challenges because 19th and 20th century sources regarding histories of  non-Christian groups are rare. Until very recently, there have been hardly  any  academic  historiographies  of  non-Christian  groups  (see  e.g.  Brown  C. 1987:253).1 Thus, my historical contextualisation of  Buddhist groups in Scotland relies almost entirely  on narratives of  history provided by Buddhist  groups themselves or other agents who merely reproduce 'insider' narratives. According  to The  Scotsman archive  (1817  onwards)  and  Rawdon  Goodier2 (2006/2007), Scotland saw the emergence of  Buddhist groups by the beginning of  the 20th  century. Around 1910 (Scotsman 1910a:1,  1910b:1), the Buddhist  Society of  the University  of  Edinburgh  announced  talks  on  Buddhism  and  the  Glasgow  and Edinburgh  lodges  of  the Theosophical  Society increasingly  became  meeting  places  for people interested in Buddhism (Goodier 2006a:1; Scotsman 1923:3). Later, in 1952, a  Scottish branch of  the Buddhist Society of  Great Britain and Northern Ireland was  founded in Edinburgh (Goodier 2006a:1; Oliver 1979:55; Humphreys 1956:106-107).In the 1960s more study groups emerged in Edinburgh (Goodier 2006b:1). These groups were often visited by Euro-Americans returning to the UK from South East Asia,  where  they  had  been  ordained.  Furthermore,  these  'western'  teachers  also  established new groups  themselves.  For  instance,  Ananda Bodhi  (Leslie  Dawson),  a Canadian  who  encountered  Buddhism  through  Theosophy  and  the London  Buddhist  Society,  set  up  the Johnston House  community in  Dumfriesshire  (Mellor  1989:175;  Oliver 1979:107).  However,  Bodhi  later  returned  to  Canada,  due  to  rivalry  in  the  British Buddhist scene, and sold Johnston House to two Tibetan immigrants (Mellor 1989:163,  175;  Rawlinson  1997:502,  569),  who  had  arrived  in  England  in  1963  (Rawlinson 1997:560).  The  two  Tibetans,  Akong  Rinpoche  and  Ch\u00f6gyam  Trungpa,  used  this opportunity to extend Johnston House,  thereby establishing Karma Kagy\u00fc Samy\u00e9 Ling, which has been considered to be the \"first Tibetan Buddhist centre in Europe\" and which has included a monastery since 1988 (Bluck 2006:110-111).1 For exceptions see, e.g. Oliver 1979 for the UK, Sutcliffe 2004b, 2006 and Whaling 1999 for Scotland.2 Biologist Rawdon Goodier is a senior member of  the Order of  Buddhist Contemplatives ('\"lay minster\") and publicly represents Buddhism, for instance, at interfaith events.- 38 -Samy\u00e9 Ling became a magnet both for people interested in Buddhism and alternative 'New Age spirituality' (cf. Bluck 2006:111) as well as for local and national media, for  instance, when the 14th Dalai Lama came to visit the monastery in 1984 and 1993 (cf.  Murray 1989:39-41) or when the main temple building was publicly opened in 1988 (see,  e.g., Gill 1988)In the 1970s the Friends of  the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO) established themselves in Glasgow, after its founder Sangharakshita had been excluded from the English Sangha  Trust in  1966  (Mellor  1989:183)  and  had  founded  the  FWBO in  1967  (Vishvapani 2001:19). In the following decades, FWBO groups spread across Scotland and were able to establish their second permanent  Buddhist centre in Edinburgh in 2006. According  to  Goodier  (2007a:1),  the  1980s  were  an  important  period  for  the Buddhist scene in Scotland because it was then that larger groups such as the Order of  Buddhist Contemplatives, the Forest Sangha, and Shambala grew stronger in Scotland. What is more, the growing number of  Asian migrants from the 1950s (Maan 1992: 3-4)  brought new narratives about Buddhism into Scottish society.  However,  not all immigrant  groups  established  institutionalised  organisations.  For  instance,  to  my knowledge,3 there  is  no  Scottish  Chinese  structure,  apart  from Falun  Gong perhaps, which represents itself  as Buddhist; however, the 2001 census listed 28% of  Buddhists as Chinese (Scottish Executive 2005:15). In contrast, Scottish Thai Buddhists, mostly first generation, saw the establishment of  an institutionalised Scottish group in 1997 and their wat in 2005.Initiatives such as the Sangha without boundaries in Edinburgh (launched 2006) or the Scottish  Inter  Faith  Council (launched 1999)  have  encouraged  the  different  Buddhist communities  to  engage  with  each  other  in  communal  activities  (e.g.,  'inter-sangha' retreats).  As  a  result,  from my experience,  numerous  members  of  Buddhist  groups possess  a  knowledge  of  their  local  Buddhist  environment.  Furthermore,  there  is  a growing consciousness to be a part of  a Buddhist scene in Scotland, even though most institutionalised groups operate on a national or even global level. These orientations also indicate the need to understand the agents promoting such 'ecumenical' projects and their particular motives involved.3 During my two terms in the Buddhist Society of  the University of  Edinburgh (then Dharma Society) with members mainly from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, who referred to themselves as ethnic Chinese, we never made contact with Chinese institutionalised groups. Even after some research, I could not find any Chinese group in Edinburgh which functioned on a 'Buddhism' basis.- 39 - 3.1.2 A brief  overview of  Buddhist institutionalised groupsSimilarly  to  other  western  European  countries (cf.  Baumann  2002:85;  Waterhouse 2001:129),  Scotland  is  characterised  by  an  enormous  diversity  in  regard to  its institutionalised Buddhist  landscape.  Nevertheless,  apart  from the Sinhalese Scotland's  Buddhist Vihara in Glasgow and the Thai Wat Dhammapadipa in Edinburgh,  most groups predominately recruit 'western' or  'converts' Buddhists.4In 2006/2007, most groups I found were located in Scotland's two biggest cities:  Glasgow and Edinburgh (cf. also Scottish Executive 2005:30). Altogether, I found 15 different  groups  (excl.  University  societies),  forming  more  than  505 institutionalised groups.  The FWBO, offering classes from the Lowlands through the Highlands to the Shetlands, run their retreat centre Dhanakosa, two larger Buddhist centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and one emerging centre in Stirling.Likewise,  groups  which  place  themselves  within  Tibetan  traditions  form  a  large fraction in terms of  group numbers. Supposedly due to the monastery's popularity and the Holy Island project, those groups affiliated with Karma Kagy\u00fc Samy\u00e9 Ling and the Rokpa Trust outnumber other Kagy\u00fc groups such as Ole Nydahl's Diamond  Way or Shambala  International, which recently started their Shambala Retreat Center in Findhorn. In addition, the New  Kadampa  Tradition (NKT) run  their  international  retreat  centre Tharpaland in Dumfries  and  have  established  two  meditation  centres  in Glasgow  and  Edinburgh, alongside  several  meditation  groups  throughout  Scotland.  Finally,  Sogyal  Rinpoche's 4 Since I did not visit all Buddhist groups in Scotland, I cannot guarantee the 'convert' milieu of  all of these groups. However, I assume the situation in Scotland not to differ much from the rest of  the UK. 5 I.e. study, meditation and practice groups, including retreat centres.- 40 -Photograph 1: Main temple at Samy\u00e9 Ling - front Rigpa advertises  one  centre  in  Edinburgh and there  is  one  group,  connected  to the Heritage Buddhist Charitable Trust, which refers to itself  as Tibetan B\u00f6n.Among such groups representing themselves as  Zen groups the Order of  Buddhist  Contemplatives (Serene  Reflection  Meditation)  appears  to  be  the  biggest  umbrella  group. Furthermore within the Zen spectrum, there are several  groups of  the Community of  Interbeing, affiliated with Thich Nat Han's Order of  Interbeing, one Western Chan group, and the Glasgow Zen  Group connected  to  Nishijima  Gudo  Wafu's  S\u014dt\u014d-Zen group Dogen Sangha.Among the groups using the term Therav\u0101da in their self-descriptions, we find the Thai  Forest  Sangha in  Glasgow  and  Edinburgh,  which  is  affiliated  with  the Aruna  Ratanagiri Buddhist Monastery in Harnham, Northumberland, and  the Sinhalese Scotland's  Buddhist Vihara in Glasgow.Other  groups  using  the  label  Buddhism  are  the  S\u014dkka  Gakkai  International  UK, represented by various district groups, and Wat Dhammapadipa in Edinburgh. The case of  Wat Dhammapadipa also points to the terminological problem of  the expression 'group' and reminds us that the number of  institutionalised groups does not necessarily correlate with group size, nor with the degree of  influence. If  one conceives of  Wat Dhammapadipa and the Thai-Scottish Association, understanding itself  as the lay Buddhist  organisation for  the  Wat,  as  one single  'group',   this  'group'  may then be regarded  as  the  centre  for  all  persons  identifying  themselves  as  Buddhist  Thais  in Scotland. To my knowledge, there are no figures of  Thai people living in Scotland, let alone the number of  Thai Buddhists. However, according to the General Register Office for  Scotland, 7366 Scottish residents responded in the 2001 Census as 'born in Thailand' \u2013 a 6 Statistics Customer Services, General Register Office for Scotland, Ladywell House, Ladywell Road, - 41 -Photograph 2: Wat Dhammapadipa - frontfigure vaguely corresponding to the Thai-Association's own estimation of  400-500 Thai Buddhists  in  Scotland.  In  comparison,  FWBO  figures  from  2006  claim  36  WBO members in Scotland (Lokabandhu 2007) plus an estimated year 2000 number of  \"over 2,000 Friends\" to be resident in the entire UK (McAra 2007:17-18). Considering that in 2007  fewer  than  one  quarter  of  FWBO groups  were  located  in  Scotland  (SFECM 2007:11-12),  the  Thai  figures  implicate,  to  a  certain  extent,  that  the  Thai  Buddhist  community is  not a  minority  group within the Buddhist  landscape in Scotland even though it constitutes only one 'group' (cf. also Baumann 2002:95).Moreover, according to the Scottish Census 2001, only 52% of  Buddhists identified themselves as 'white'. In addition, only 39.39%7 of  the Buddhist population in Great Britain ticked 'white'  in the 2001 census (see table below).  This  raises  the question,  especially  for  Great  Britain,  why  academic  encounters  with  the  phenomenon  of 'Buddhism in the West' are most often concerned with groups predominately drawing 'white' Buddhists client\u00e8le (see Kay 2004:32-34; cf. Numrich 1996:xxi-xxii; Waterhouse  2001:121-122). An answer to this may certainly lie, as indicated above, in the 'western'  academic focus on institutionalised groups.8 However, if  the full spectrum of  Buddhist activity in a regional  area is  to be investigated, a study focus based solely on group  numbers, which does not take into account that certain forms of  institutionalisation particularly take place in 'western' Buddhist groups, seems to be inadequate.Scotland England & WalesNorthern IrelandGreat BritainUnited KingdomPopulation in total:9 5,062,011 52,041,916 1,685,267 57,103,927 58,789,194Buddhists in total: 6,83010 144,45311 53312 151,283 151,816% Buddhists: 0.13% 0.28% 0.03% 0.26% 0.26%% 'White' Buddhists: 52%13 38.79%14 n/a 39.39% n/aTable 1: People with a Buddhist identity in Great Britain/ United Kingdom; Source: 2001 Census Data of  the UK, Scotland, England & Wales, and Northern Ireland.Edinburgh, EH12 7TF; email from 24/07/2007.7 It was not possible to find out the 'white'  proportion of  the 533 Buddhists in Northern Ireland, which is why I have to restrict myself  to mainland Britain (Great Britain).8 See, e.g., Bluck (2006:3), who identifies Britain's largest Buddhist groups on the basis of  their institutionalisation.9 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=185; accessed 27/07/200710 Scottish Executive 2005:37.11 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=6892&More=Y; accessed 27/07/200712 http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/Excel/KS07c.xls; accessed 27/07/200713 Scottish Executive 2005:15.14 http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=6892&More=Y; accessed 27/07/2007- 42 - 3.2 FWBO 'Buddhism' 3.2.1 Contextualising FWBO narratives about BuddhismThe Friends of  the Western Buddhist  Order,  consisting  of  the  institution FWBO and  its 'inner  circle'  of  ordained W B O members (sometimes  orthographically  reflected  as F/WBO), is one of  the better researched groups within the spectrum of  contemporary Buddhist movements (e.g., Batchelor 1994; Baumann 1993; Bell 1991, 1996; Bluck 2006; McAra 2007; Mellor 1989, 1991, 1992;  Kantowsky 2003; Oliver 1979; Rawlinson 1997; Waterhouse 2001). The FWBO describes itself  as having been established in London in 1967  by  Sangharakshita,  also  known  as  Dennis  Lingwood  or  'Bhante'  (Vishvapani [2000]2006b; 2001:15, 19)In  terms  of  stratification,  the  FWBO offers  the following  identities  (cf.  Bell  1996:94):  \"Order member\"  (ordained  full-time  members),  \"Mitra\" (initiated  members)  and  \"Friend\"  (e.g.,  recurrent visitors/  class  participants).  Since  Sangharakshita retired completely in 2000, major decisions about the ordination process have been made by the College  of  Public  Preceptors,  currently  a  group  of  31  WBO members  (Dhammarati  2007).  Nonetheless,  local Buddhist centres, for instance, the Glasgow Buddhist Centre and the Edinburgh Buddhist Centre, with their respective  directors  Viryadevi  and  Kalyanavaca possess a certain autonomy (cf. Vishvapani 2006a:14). Overall, the FWBO movement may  be  described  as  a  heterogeneous  movement,  encompassing,  for  instance,  the Madhyamaloka \"think  tank\" (Vishvapania  2006a:2), the  publishing  house Windhorse  Publications and wholefood shops such as The New Leaf in Edinburgh.It  represents  itself  as  a  global  movement  which  is  not  restricted  to  'the  West'. According to the FWBO (Lokabandhu 2007, SFECM 2007), 24.2% of  its 1380 Order members and 20.2% of  the centres and groups were located outside North America,  UK/Europe, Australia/New Zealand). Nevertheless, the UK remains the focal point of FWBO activities.- 43 -Photograph 3: Glasgow Buddhist Centre -        entrance As  examined  by  Hellen  Waterhouse  (2001:146-147),  the  FBWO  propagates  its discourse on Buddhism via professionalised public relations, magazines, and education material for religious education teachers (Clear Vision Trust).  In addition, the general representation of  Buddhism in St. Mungo Museum of  Religious Life and Art in Glasgow was created  in  cooperation  with  the  FWBO  Glasgow  Buddhist  centre.15 Furthermore, FWBO narratives about Buddhism are delivered through the Scottish Inter Faith Council, public  evening classes,  open days, and  numerous  FWBO websites,  provided  via  the FwboNet Webhosting Business16, which all contribute to the FWBO's high visibility.When conducting fieldwork with the FWBO in Scotland (see 1.3.1), I encountered narratives of  Buddhism during meditation classes and informal tea breaks; information was delivered in a teacher/pupil mode and senior members often took an authoritative role  in  explaining  Buddhism.  Moreover,  I  was  immediately  confronted  with Sangharakshita as a major reference point within the FWBO. Indeed, narratives of  the FWBO movement  are  not  imaginable  without  reference  to  this  individual  \u2013   be  it  criticisms against the movement (within and outside the movement), such as the FWBO files (Schnake 2007[2000]) or accusations appearing in The Guardian newspaper (Bunting 1997),  etic  descriptions  or  self-representations.  Reading  his  books  was  soon recommended to all beginners; his life was presented as a hagiography \u2013 at least in my  direct encounters with FWBO members. Books  and talks  by  Sangharakshita  are  available  in  FWBO libraries  and  local  book shops,  published by Windhorse,  or for free on the internet17.  Thus,   within FWBO 15 I learnt this when I was working for the museum in 2006.16 http://www.fwbo.net; accessed 22/09/200717 http://www.freebuddhistaudio.com; accessed 04/10/2007- 44 -Photograph 5: Glasgow Buddhist Centre - meditation room    Photograph 4: Glasgow Buddhist Centre - library               'Buddhism',  Sangharakshita (still)  holds a major,  legitimising function,  which may be described as the transmission of  knowledge about the core of  Buddhism. Today, of course, Sangharakshita's  conception of  Buddhism is just one element within FWBO 'Buddhism'; nevertheless,  it is a key element and, at the same time, an orientation point and 'deep structure' (cf. 4.2.2) for other narratives in the FWBO. 3.2.2 Sangharakshita's narrative about BuddhismSangharakshita's  conception  of  Buddhism is  intertwined  with  his  narrative  of (true) religion,  which he  defines  in terms  of  mutually  excluding  contrasts  (1975:8):  \"blind belief\",  \"acceptance  of  any  creed  or  dogma\",  which  he  rejects,  versus  \"energetic  practice\" and \"the achievement of  [...] experiences\". Thus, he dissociates his concept of  religion from what he takes to be \"conventional religion\" (Sangharakshita 1966b:5). In addition, Sangharakshita expands his new definition by a twofold dichotomy: \"Religion-as-Revelation [...]  places the strongest possible emphasis on faith in God, faith in His prophet, messenger or incarnation, faith in His infallible Word, faith in His Church, faith in His priest. [...] Moreover, Religion-as-Revelation's house is divided not only against itself  but against other houses as well - against Science, for instance, which has succeeded in demonstrating the fallibility of  many an infallible scripture.\" \"Religion-as-Discovery,  on  the  other  hand,  holds  that  Religion  is  essentially  a manifestation of  the human spirit,  that  man is  able  to  discover  the Way to Truth himself  by means of  his own unaided human efforts [...]. It sees Science not as an enemy but as a friend and fellow worker.\"  (Sangharakshita 1975:19-20)This revelation/discovery-distinction helps Sangharakshita to differentiate between one system which is \"divided against itself\", \"against Science\", and encompasses \"fallibility\", and a second, preferable system which is \"unaided\", dependent on \"one's own volition\" (1975:19) and has \"Science\" as a friend.  Having constructed his fundament of  religion,  Sangharakshita is able to classify  different forms or 'species' of  religion:\"The  three  extant  Semitic  religions,  Judaism,  Christianity  and  Islam are  clearly  all dominated by the conception of  Religion-as-Revelation. [...] Buddhism and Taoism18 are  perhaps  the  only  religions  which  consistently  adhere,  in  their  oldest  and  most authoritative scriptures, to the conception of  Religion-as-Discovery.\"(Sangharakshita 1975:21)18 Daoism is described as \"not wholly free from the suspicion of  Buddhist influence.\" (1975:23)- 45 -This  quote  illustrates  two  common  argumentative  patterns  of  Sangharakshita's teachings:  first,  Buddhism is the choice if  one does not wish to follow \"Semitic\" or theistic religions; second, proper Buddhism is found through its oldest scriptures \u2013 a claim deeply embedded within FWBO discourse, encouraging FWBO members to study \"primary texts\" (cf. Waterhouse 2001:149). Moreover,  Sangharakshita's  thinking  encompasses  notions  of  an  evolutionary development of  religion (cf. Sangharakshita 1975:24). For instance, \"Semitic religions\" are  an  expression  of  a  preliminary  stage  in  the  process  of  evolution,  of  which Buddhism as \"Religion-as-Discovery\" is the last step. Sangharakshita elaborates on this process, which is not solely \"spiritual\",  in his concept of  \"Higher Evolution\":\"So Buddhism recognizes two great categories: the category of  the ordinary man, and the  category  of  the  Enlightened  man.  [...] What  we  call  the  lower  evolution corresponds to the whole process of  development from amoeba up to ordinary man, or  unenlightened  man.  This  is  a  predominantly  biological  process,  a  process  that becomes psychological  towards the end. The Higher  Evolution corresponds to the whole process - the whole course of  development which leads from unenlightened man up to Enlightened man [...].\"(Sangharakshita1980:13, 19)The above strategy consists  of  the transfer  of  evolution theory into a  stratificatory concept of  human beings, in which \"biology\" is extended by \"psyche\". Through this, Sangharakshita  moves  the  state  of  being  \"Enlightened\"  outside  the  biological  (i.e. material)  sphere  and  becomes  able  to  'enchant'  a  theory  of  human  hierarchy:  the \"ordinary\" versus \"Enlightened\" human being, a dichotomy which Sangharakshita also describes, almost in Eliadian manner, as \"ordinary life\" versus \"spiritual life\" (1980:36-37;  cf.  Eliade  [1957]1990:16-17).  In  sum,  religion  as  defined  by  Sangharakshita  is  a teleological system, based upon individual experience, which is available to those who are already progressing on the evolutionary path (1966a:15).Sangharakshita places Buddhism within this layer of  \"religion\". As indicated above, Buddhism is regarded as the option available to those truly interested in religion. \"[A]mong  the  universal  religions,  the  three  universal  religions,  there  was  a  theistic group, and a non-theistic group. The theistic group comprising Christianity and Islam, the non-theistic group comprising simply Buddhism. [...] The language of  theism has become  meaningless  to  many  of  us.  We  require  some  kind  of  religion  as  the instrument of  our own higher evolution, having developed a certain degree of  self-awareness. The ethnic religions are not available, are not even accessible to us; among the universal religions, two are ruled out on account of  their theistic background, and the only one that remains therefore is Buddhism.\" (Sangharakshita 1966b:1)- 46 -Here, Sangharakshita, referring in his quote to his talks Is religion necessary? (1966b) and Religion:  ethnic  and  universal (1966a),  creates  a  taxonomy  of  \"non-theistic\",  \"theistic\", \"ethnic\" and \"universal\" religions, which is analogous to the constructs of  19th century  European  liberal  theology  (cf.  Masuzawa 2005:140).  In  fact,  it  is  his  emphasis  on distinguishing  \"universal\"  (accessible)  from \"ethnic\"  (non-accessible)  religions,  which leaves him with the same problem as 19th century Orientalist scholars: the claim of  the universality of  Buddhism, and therefore independence from regionally limited religions,  against  the  empirical  evidence  of  immense  diversity  among  the  religious  traditions grouped under the category of  'Buddhism' (cf. Masuzawa 2005: 138, 144).Sangharakshita's response to this problem, already introduced above, is  consistent with that of  Orientalist scholars: first, the textualisation of  Buddhism (i.e., to construct a  'true  Buddhism';  Masuzawa  2005:131);19 second,  and  a  subsequent  strategy,  is Sangharakshita's postulation that Buddhism is underpinned by a universal essence. This essence can be distilled and \"integrated\" (1992b:3) into different cultures:20 \"When Buddhism overflowed the boundaries of  India an poured into the surrounding Asian countries it was but natural that those life-giving waters should irrigate the fields of  the hearts and minds of  their inhabitants through the emotional and intellectual channels already formed there by habits and customs centuries old. Just as a man who goes to live in a foreign country learns its  language,  so did Buddhism acquire the language of  the countries to which its beneficent influence spread, [...]. The soil where from the great tree of  Buddhism grew may have been rich or poor, the flowers which is produced, red or white or blue in colour, but the Seed from which it germinated, and the flavour of  the Fruit it ultimately bore, were always one.\" (Sangharakshita 1975:54)We learn that Buddhism, the universal \"Seed\", is encoded in language, not in the literal meaning  (1975:51)  but  in  the  sense  of  a  medium,  in  order  to  spread  to  different cultures, which Sangharakshita comprehends in regional terms (\"soil\").This argumentation becomes particularly important when Sangharakshita (re-)defines English culture (1966c:9-11). He firstly deconstructs notions that equate English culture with Christian culture and secondly demarcates  the particular  Christian space within \"English\" culture that is to be replaced by (\"distilled\") Buddhism:19 See also Sangharakshita 1996:23, 35: \"Such, then, are the general characteristics of  the Theravada, of Pure Land Buddhism, of  Zen, and of  Tibetan Buddhism, especially in so far as these characteristics constitute for us in the Order, as well as throughout the FWBO, a source of  inspiration and spiritual guidance. We derive that inspiration and guidance, however, not so much from these schools in the form in which they survive in the East, and have been introduced in the West, as from a selection of the scriptures on which, in principle, they respectively are based.\"20 Here, my analysis of  the FWBO differs from Helen Waterhouse's assessment (2001:147).- 47 -\"[I]n its essence, intrinsically, substantially, Buddhism is really no more Eastern than Western, any more than Christianity is. [...] [T]his will be a sort of  test for English Buddhists - whether they're capable of  extracting the essence of  Buddhism, the non-geographical  non-cultural  supra-cultural  essence of  Buddhism, and distilling it  as  it were, and keeping to just that, and creating out of  it their own cultural form.\" (Sangharakshita 1966c:11)In  addition,  Sangharakshita  proposes  the  replacement  of  Christianity,  constituting  a stage of  \"Lower  Evolution\", by Celtic Paganism, which is another \"lower\" stage but the  ethnic religion of  the English:\"[I]  feel  it  is  important  that  people  generally,  including  Buddhists  in  this  country, should  try  to  establish  contact  with  their  own pre-Christian  past.  [...]  Personally  I wouldn't mind seeing a combination, as it were, of  Celtic Paganism and Buddhism - the one, you may say, for the majority and the other for the minority, and each perfectly tolerant towards the other. So that it would be easy to pass, for those who wished, from the one to the other, from the ethnic to the universal, from the Lower to the Higher.\" (Sangharakshita 1966a:14-15)This model incorporates a certain flexibility in that it provides an interface for converts  to include whatever they may construct as a 'Celtic' element of  'their' culture.Moreover,  Sangharakshita  develops  an  apocalyptic  narrative,  which  justifies  why Buddhism should be brought to the West and why there should be such a thing as  \"English Buddhism\":\"[T]raditional  Buddhism  is  in  a  state  of  decline,  and  [...]  committed  Buddhists everywhere need to give serious thought to the question of  how best to preserve the Dharma  for the benefit of  future generations. One of  the ways in which we of  the Western Buddhist Order can help preserve the Dharma is by acquainting ourselves with the general characteristics of  the Theravada, of  Pure Land Buddhism, of  Zen, and  of  Tibetan Buddhism, especially  in so far as these characteristics constitute a source of  inspiration and spiritual guidance to us, and it is to the four schools and their scripture we must now turn. (Sangharakshita 1996:18)In fact, the above narrative provides a framework for the construction of  WBO identity around one basic goal: the preservation of  a declining Buddhism, in a singular sense (see also Sangharakshita 1996:23) \u2013 achieved by maintaining the \"general characteristics\" of  those Buddhist schools which Sangharakshita identifies as most important.In my reading of  Sangharakshita, the foundation of  his construction of  Buddhism appears to be a particular notion of  evolution theory meshed with the 'Buddhism as a tomato'  paradigm  (see 2.3.2),  which  is  itself  a  descendant  of  a  long-prevailing, essentialist  phenomenology-of-religions  approach.  Furthermore,  the  resemblances  to - 48 -Victorian discourse on Buddhism, as closely examined, for instance, by Almond (1988), are  remarkable:  most  importantly,  the  construction  of  an  ideal  Buddhism  out  of scripture,  which  enables  Sangharakshita  to  judge  contemporary Asian  Buddhism as decaying  (cf.  Almond   1988:40);   the  redefinition  of  religion  in  order  to  compare  Buddhism with other systems called 'religion' (cf. Almond 1988:94); the differentiation between Semitic and Aryan religions (cf. Masuzawa 2005:214-215); the differentiation between ethnic/national and universal religions (cf. Masuzawa 2005:137-138); and the concept of  evolution and a self-dependent 'soteriology' (cf. Clausen 1975:5-6).In  conclusion,  one  may  characterise  Sangharakshita's  construction  of  Buddhism partially as a carrier of  Victorian discourse on Buddhism, which has come to life during  the second half  of  the 20th century. 3.2.3 The wider FWBO discourse on BuddhismOfficial FWBO publications and FWBO members draw intensively on Sangharakshita's statements.  However,  according  to  Vishvapani (2006a:9,  11,  17), Sangharakshita's authority has been contested as a result of  outside criticism against the FWBO and the organisational  re-structuring  of  the  FWBO  after  Sangharakshita's  retirement. Vishvapani (2006a:20)  also mentions that Sangharakshita's  writings are less read,  but new and previously 'unorthodox'  practices  have become popular  and,  what is  more, Sangharakshita's evolutionary model has been questioned. Nevertheless, as indicated in 3.2.1, Sangharakshita's teachings remain a focal point in the FWBO movement and I consider, at least from the limited time I spent with the FWBO in Scotland, the fundamental structures wherein he constructed Buddhism for the  movement to  be  still  active.  This  point  can  be  illustrated  by  descriptions  of Buddhism on the FWBO's  official website: \"The FWBO is an international network dedicated to communicating Buddhist truths in ways appropriate to the modern world. The essence of  Buddhism is timeless and universal.  But  the  forms  it  takes  always  adapt  according  to  context.  Now  that Buddhism is spreading around the globe, the task is to create new Buddhist traditions relevant to the 21st century.\"(FWBO 2007a)- 49 -Again,  it  is  the universal,  never-changing essence of  Buddhism upon which FWBO 'Buddhism' is constituted \u2013 an  idea which can be found in various forms within FWBO 'Buddhism' (see, e.g., Vishvapani 2001:13). Furthermore, in other representational texts by the FWBO it becomes clear that the essentialist idea derives from Sangharakshita's construction of  Buddhism, which dominates the framework for those who identify with the movement:\"Bringing Buddhism into an entirely new culture implied to Sangharakshita that we needed  to  go  back to  basics  \u2014 to  look at  the  principles  underlying  all  forms  of Buddhism and work out how best to apply them in this new context. So, the FWBO is an ecumenical movement, aligned to no one traditional school, but drawing on the whole stream of  Buddhist inspiration. The FWBO has evolved new structures that allow people to live out Buddhist teachings as an authentic Buddhist way of  life in the 21st century.\"                (FWBO 2007b)This quote claims, again, that Buddhism \u2013 on the basis of  its common denominator or \"principles  underlying  all  forms  of  Buddhism\"  \u2013  is  culturally  invariant  and  can  be discovered  by  a  search  conducted backwards.  What  is  more,  the  FWBO approach is characterised as  \"ecumenical\"  which is  an important element in  the construction of  FBWO identity:\"[T]he FWBO is what I\u2019ve called an ecumenical Buddhist movement. [...] We don\u2019t say we are Theravadin; we don\u2019t say that we are Mahayana; we don\u2019t say that we follow Tibetan Buddhism; we don\u2019t say that we\u2019re a Vajrayana tradition. We don\u2019t say any of those things. We say simply that we\u2019re Buddhist. That we are Buddhist movement, a Buddhist tradition, if  you like a Buddhist lineage.\"(Sangharakshita [2002]2007)Indeed, this quote reveals a basic rule affecting the general discourse on Buddhism: in order to present themselves as \"authentic\" Buddhism (FWBO 2007b), the FWBO has to construct an identity that acknowledges the plurality of  Buddhist groups:\"[T]he Order, and with it the FWBO, is a branch of  the mighty tree of  Buddhism which, for more than 2,500 years, has sheltered a considerable portion of  humanity, and [...] the same vital juice that circulates in the older, bigger branches of  that tree circulates in our younger, smaller branch too, even if  it circulates in it a little more vigorously than it does in some of  them.\"(Sangharakshita 1996:13)This  anchoring  of  FWBO identity  within  the  wider  spectrum of  Buddhist  groups became necessary after the number of  agents participating in the construction of  the  public discourse on Buddhism increased. Sangharakshita's first attempt to construct a genuinely English Buddhism, a common goal in the beginnings of  'Buddhism' in the UK (see, e.g., Humphreys 1968:54), failed when he was expelled from the English Sangha  Trust (cf. Mellor 1989:90). Nevertheless, he continued and founded the FWBO with the - 50 -intention to be completely independent from what he considered to be traditional Asian Buddhist movements. Since the Buddhist landscape has changed in the UK, with more and more Buddhist groups emerging and defining Buddhism in their own ways, the pressure has increased  for the FBWO to re-adjust itself  within this framework (cf. Waterhouse 2001:120-121). For instance, Sangharakshita  delivered six distinctions to demarcate the FWBO from other Buddhist movements (Sangharakshita [2002]2007):(1) FWBO Buddhism as \"ecumenical\" Buddhism (cf. Sangharakshita 2007 above), which incorporates all  (Buddhist) traditions \u2013 that is, of  course, all  traditions  which the FWBO recognises as a Buddhist tradition.(2) The (construction of  an) underlying principle of  Buddhism which is the \"central act of  going for Refuge\", i.e. the commitment a person takes for 'taking refuge to the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha'. (3) Social inclusivism and an approach that is applicable to every human being:\"We\u2019re also a unified Buddhist Order in the sense that we accept people from whatever cultural,  racial  or social  background, and we make no distinction between people, also, with regard to sexual orientation.\"(4) The  application of  'Buddhist ethics' to society and the attempt to create a new, Buddhist society (e.g. 'right livelihood business').(5) The inclusion of  cultural products that the FWBO constructs as art, which is modelled upon a bourgeois conception of  art:\"I came into contact with, especially the poetry of  Shelley, Shakespeare, Rilke and Wordsworth; and I was inspired by the great art that I encountered. [...] I\u2019m not  saying  everybody needs  to  be widely  read or  very  knowledgeable about the arts \u2014 no \u2014 but, yes, a poem or a picture can be a source of  great inspiration to us [...]. We all know how inspiring we find certain Buddha and Bodhisattva images, thangkas and icons.\"(6) The concept of  \"spiritual friendship\" as the fundamentum of  the FWBO.As I noted above, such demarcations may be understood as a reaction to the increasing  number of  participants in the discourse on Buddhism. To form a singular 'Buddhism' such as 'British Buddhism' or 'English Buddhism', controlled by one group,  has not been  possible.   For  instance,  Christmas  Humphreys' London  Buddhist  Society,  which controlled the discourse on Buddhism, at least, until the 1960s, has become a rather peripheral agent today. - 51 -By contrast, FWBO 'Buddhism' has survived, now emphasising its special role within the 'Buddhism-in-the-West' narrative. In my opinion, as long as 'Buddhism-in-the-West' is constructed as a continuing journey, i.e. an unfinished business, FWBO 'Buddhism' can be firmly rooted within the public discourse on Buddhism. The success of  FWBO 'Buddhism'  does  not  depend  on  whether  FWBO  members  plausibly  present  their 'essence of  Buddhism', on which the FWBO builds its authenticity. Rather, its impact and influence depends on the degree of  its public visibility  \u2013 a topic the FWBO, in a McLuhanian 'the medium is the message' manner (McLuhan 1964), has addressed most professionally of  all institutionalised Buddhist groups in Scotland so far. 3.2.4 DiscussionIn short, FWBO 'Buddhism' may be described as a  medium preserving parts of  the  Victorian  discourse  on  Buddhism,  basically  established  through  Sangharakshita's teachings, which have been strongly influenced by, what one may call, the 'theosophical  Buddhism' of  the London Buddhist Society (see, e.g., Humphreys 1968:18).Applying Marshall  McLuhan's (e.g., 1964:23-24) dichotomy of  cool and hot media (i.e. media of  low and high definition), Buddhism, as the imagined object of  'Buddhism', may be considered as currently being in a cool aggregate, compared to, for instance, Democracy.21 The  discourse  on democracy is  relatively  clear  and  requires  little  effort  to determine its meaning; in Europe, anybody is able to use it and everybody believes they know its meaning, which is why it is easy to communicate, for instance, in newspapers.  In contrast, details of Buddhism have been minimally distributed on a public level; a high  degree of  effort and participation on the recipient's side is  required to fill it with data for  constructing  its  meaning.  Here,  in  this  process,  the  FWBO narratives  about Buddhism fulfil the role of  transforming cool Buddhism into hot Buddhism; this means, the FWBO delivers  data to complement the black box 'Buddhism',  which has been inherited from European orientalist scholarship. These data, of  course, are a reflection of  FWBO members' concerns with their lives and environment.21 This, of  course, depends completely on the recipient of  narratives about Buddhism (i.e., the cool/hot-dichotomy is completely relational).- 52 -For  instance,  the  'construction  set'  Buddhism  can  be  used  to  create  \"Buddhist ethics\", \"Right livelihood\", new sexual morals (Vishvapani 2001:39, 46; Sangharakshita 1966a:14)  and  other  activities  and  beliefs  which  are  contrasted  with  a  constructed 'other', i.e., Christianity or theism in general. What is more, the 'essence' approach to Buddhism prevailing in the FWBO discourse can be mixed, for instance, with nation-building discourses. As noted above, Sangharakshita constructed a pre-Christian \"Celtic Paganism\". This has been taken up by Irish FWBO Buddhists, who created a \"Celtic Puja\", which has also been introduced to Scotland (cf. Nunamaker 2007:1).22 Nevertheless, FWBO narratives of  Buddhism have been in a 'competitive situation' since other narrators have also been 'warming up' Buddhism. Certainly, the FWBO is a \"major player in terms of  a voice for Buddhism in the UK\" (Waterhouse 2001:146). However, other narratives attempt to anchor and emphasise topics such as 'lineage' and tradition, 'monkhood' and 'celibacy' within the public discourse on Buddhism, which are challenging for the FWBO.23 As I have argued before, it is crucial for the FWBO to remain  powerful  in  presenting  Buddhism,  so  that  FWBO  'Buddhism'  can  still  be included in public discourse (see, e.g., Scottish Inter Faith Council, n.d.:4-5)This  also  involves  demarcation  from other  discourses,  for  instance,  'Theosophy', 'New Age' or Philip Mellor's 'Protestant Buddhism' (Mellor 1989, 1991, 1992). Mellor's assessment of  the FWBO as one of  the Buddhist  movements on which \"Christian discourses and forms of  life continue to have an observable influence\" (see 4.2.2)  have been heavily criticised by FWBO authorities (Kulananda 1992; Sangharakshita 1992a).  In FWBO 'Buddhism', Buddhism must not be a reproduction of  Protestantism, i.e. of Christianity;  Christianity  is  'the  other'  against  which  FWBO  identity  has  been constructed.  The FWBO  has  overcome the  \"lower  stage\"   of  Christianity;  FWBO 'Buddhism'  is  based  on  the  claim  that  \"Buddhism  does  not  include  the  idea  of worshipping a creator god\" (FWBO 2007c), separating itself  from what it considers to be at the centre of  its 'other'. 22 Furthermore, discourse on political identity such as Scottish nationality is taken seriously; e.g., for Scotland there especially exists the FWBO website www.fwboscotland.org (accessed 06/09/2007).23 Such topics are challenging because the FWBO discourse focuses on the principle of  'going for refuge' (cf. p47). Therefore, there is no dogma of  'monkhood' or 'celibacy'; nor does the FWBO 'Buddhism' built upon a lineage concept, albeit Sangharakshita has published narratives about his teachers (e.g. Sangharakshita 2007)- 53 -Likewise,  Vishvapani (1994),  in his  response to a  draft  version of  Denise Cush's British Buddhism and the New Age (1996), is concerned with distinguishing Buddhism from (eclectic) practices he finds characteristic for what he defines as New Age:\"If  we simply take what we want from Buddhism we are in danger of  ignoring the aspects which are uncomfortable and challenging-in other words, those parts of  the tradition which will force one to change. For this reason it is important that Buddhism is presented in a way which makes it clear that it cannot be incorporated into a life which is otherwise unchanged or subsumed innocuously into a New Age mix.\"(Vishvapani 1994:18-19)These reactions become clearer when viewed in the light of  another important aspect of  FWBO  'Buddhism'.  This  is  its  firm  embededness  in  and  the  extension  of  the 'Buddhism-in-the-West' myth (see 2.3):  the FWBO is seen as distinct from all the other Buddhisms in 'the West', which are viewed as copies of  Asian forms of  Buddhism (cf. Vishvapani 2001:13). The FWBO does not only provide Buddhism for 'the West' but facilitates the \"integration of  Buddhism into Western society\" (Sangharakshita 1992b:1), resulting  in  a  new  (localised)  form  of  Buddhism,  namely  \"Western  Buddhism\" (Kulananda 1997).2424 For instance, one WBO member explained to me that it may take 100 years or more of  integrating Buddhism into 'the West' until a distinct Western Buddhist iconography and vocabulary will emerge. However, in the end, Buddhism will be merged with 'western culture' just as Christianity has been.- 54 - 3.3 Karma Kagy\u00fc Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' 3.3.1 Contextualising Samy\u00e9 Ling narratives about BuddhismLocated in Eskdalemuir in the Scottish Borders, Karma Kagy\u00fc Samy\u00e9 Ling, established in 1967,  is  commonly presented as the first Tibetan Buddhist centre and monastery in Europe. Its large temple, which received local and national media interest when officially opened in 1988 (e.g. Gill 1988), has become an important landmark within the Buddhist  scene in Scotland. In addition, the Holy Island Project, launched in 1992 by Samy\u00e9 Ling's current \"abbot\", Yeshe Losal, on Holy Island near the Isle of  Arran, opened its Centre  for  World  Peace  and  Health in  2003 (Bluck  2006:112;  Janson  2007:  26-27;  Sutcliffe 2004b:92-93)  and  is  another  major  reference  point  within  the  public  discourse  on  Buddhism in Scotland (see SIFC n.d.:24; Tennant 1995:28; McGinty 2004).Nevertheless, academic consideration of  the forty year-long existence of  Samy\u00e9 Ling has been marginal. Many academics producing studies within the field of  Buddhism in the UK are aware of  the Samy\u00e9 Ling community (e.g. Kay 2004, Henry 2006, Batchelor 1994, Mellor 1989, Rawlinson 1997; Cush 1996). However, to my knowledge, only Ian Oliver (1979), Thessa Ploos van Amstel (2005), Helen Waterhouse (1997) and Robert Bluck (2006) have academically explored this movement, which Bluck (2006:3) describes as the Karma Kagy\u00fc representative within the seven largest Buddhist groups in Britain.  Nonetheless, no critical history of  the entire community has yet been produced.25 25 The only detailed history of  Samy\u00e9 Ling I found was an insider narrative delivered by Khandro (2007).- 55 -Photograph 6 Holy Island - main building  Photograph 7: Holy Island - Mandala garden   For the purpose of  definition, I shall consider Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' to have begun in 1967 when the Johnstone House community around Ananda Bodhi declined and the  two  Tibetans  Akong  Rinpoche  and  Ch\u00f6gyam  Trungpa  took  over  the  grounds  in Dumfriesshire, establishing their own Buddhist community. It was at this time that the community was dominated by what Bluck (2006:111) calls \"'New Age' attitudes\" (cf. also Khandro 2007:20; Yeats 1984). Today, the Samy\u00e9 Ling community is  a global agent and has established some 40 centres around the world under its registered umbrella charity Rokpa Trust, which has its headquarters in Switzerland. Outside Europe, the USA and Canada, it has centres in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nepal and India. The focal point, however, remains the UK incorporating c. 44% of  its institutionalised groups (Khandro 2007:132-145).The 'Buddhism' generated by the Samy\u00e9 Ling community is very much related to Akong Rinpoche26 and his brother Yeshe Losal, who arrived at Samy\u00e9 Ling in 1969 and who was ordained in 1980 (Khandro 2007:23, 52). In addition, other Kagy\u00fcpa teachers  are frequently invited to the community and their writings, for example, those by the  12th Tai Situpa  and Ringu Tulku Rinpoche, are recommended in classes.The  concept  of  lineage,  i.e.  the  idea  that  a  particular  form  of  knowledge  is \"transmitted\"  from  guru  to  disciple,  is  widely  accepted.  For  instance,  during  my encounters  with  the  community,  several  sessions  and  classes  started  with  a  Karma Kagy\u00fc \"lineage-prayer\" (dorj\u00e9 chang thungma), which may be described as a homage  to  the (fictive)27 founding gurus of  the Kagy\u00fc school. Furthermore, at a so-called \"refuge ceremony\",  which  for  many  participants  represented  a  'conversion'-ritual,  it  was emphasised that  the first refuge must be taken to one's lama and then to the Buddha, dharma,  and sangha.  This  may also  explain  why Akong Rinpoche and Yeshe Losal  appear  at  the  centre  of  narratives  within  the  Samy\u00e9  Ling  community  and  why,  for instance, during classes I found that my instructors would sometimes literally reproduce what I had just read in one of  the brother's books.Yeshe Losal, also an executive member of  the Scottish Inter Faith Council,28  and other  ordained  sangha  members  represent  Buddhism  to  politicians,  other  religious  26 For the purpose of  simplicity, I will refer to the second Akong Tulku as Akong Rinpoche and Lama Yeshe Losal (aka Jamdrak or Jamphel Drakpa) as Yeshe Losal, even though Yeshe Losal has also received the title of  a Rinpoche.27 From a historico-empirical point of  view.28 http://www.samyeling.org/index.php?module=Pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=17&pid=9; accessed 13/10/2007.- 56 -specialists,  school  classes,  academic  researchers  and  the  media.  The  Samy\u00e9  Ling community  also  offers  introductions  to  their  'Buddhism'  at  their  centres,  which  are continuously spreading. Nevertheless,  Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' is  not restricted to the monastery or study groups: Long-term members of  the Samy\u00e9 Ling community have published  articles  in  Buddhist  journals  (e . g. Tricycle o r Dharma  Life);  Samy\u00e9  Ling headquarters  and  Samy\u00e9  Dzongs,  i.e.  centres  in  cities,  provide  material  on  their respective  websites;  and  one  can  easily  find  most  Samy\u00e9  Ling  narratives  also  on Wikipedia. Samy\u00e9 Ling's online-shop29 delivers printed teachings, audio recordings, and meditation  material  or  Tibetan  accessories.  Thus,  Samy\u00e9  Ling  'Buddhism'  is  made available through different media independent of  any spatial limits. 3.3.2 Yeshe Losal's and Akong Rinpoche's narratives about BuddhismSince  Yeshe  Losal  and  his  brother  Akong  Rinpoche  take  a  central  role  in  the  construction  of  Samy\u00e9  Ling  'Buddhism',  I  will  briefly  introduce  some tendencies  I  observed in their publicly available teachings. Both brothers address the relational space in which Buddhism can be located and specify its connection to 'religion'. However, they do not attempt to define religion or  to anchor Buddhism to a grid of  religions they  have classified before:\"Nowadays, some people are put off  by just hearing the word 'religion', but Buddhism is not so much a religion as a philosophy or a way of  life.\"(Yeshe Losal 2001:1)\"I think the main difference between the Buddhist path and others is that Buddhism always says that you have to deal with all obstacles and that you should not try to escape from anything - including yourself.\" (Akong Rinpoche 2007; 1997)The above quotes illustrate that at the centre of  their concern is \"a way of  life\" or \"path\", acknowledging that there are other paths as well. Obviously, the brothers realise  (1) that  their audience may consider Buddhism as a religion and (2) that this may create  a competitive situation with other systems classified as religions. One strategy to counter  this is to dissociate their teachings from 'religion' or even  'Buddhism':29 www.samyelingshop.com; accessed 10/10/2007.- 57 -\"When we talk about Buddhism, we are actually talking about the mind. If  you do not want to hear about 'Buddhism', the 'Buddha' or 'enlightenment', we can leave out such words and talk only about the mind.\"\"I always remind people that the religion they follow makes no difference. If  their practice helps them become more humble, better human beings [...], then I think they have achieved their goal!\"(Yeshe Losal, 2001:3; emphasis added)Thus,  \"Tibetan teachings for improving your daily  life\" (Akong Rinpoche 1994) are  presented as available to everybody. This inclusivism is constructed upon the idea of  the Buddha-nature of  all (sentient) beings, as the following quote illustrates:\"Buddhism teaches about equality: that differences in race, culture, tradition, belief  do not really matter. The fundamental teaching in Buddhism is that everybody has the opportunity  and  possibility  to  become  a  Buddha.  Every  human  being  has  this potential.\"(Yeshe Losal 2001:2)All of  these narratives decrease barriers created by social-identity constructs. Hence, the 'other' against which Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' is constructed, is not an already established  identity marker such as 'to be Christian' (as in the case of  the FWBO), but the \"modern materialistic way of  life\":\"When people come to realise that this modern materialistic way of  life is meaningless, I think that they will gradually accept the Buddhist teachings, but I am definitely not trying to make a Buddhist out of  anyone. Buddhism is very open and teaches respect for all other beliefs. (Yeshe Losal 2001:2; emphasis added)Furthermore, Yeshe Losal creates a contrast between the modern \"path\" or \"ordinary life\", characterised by selfishness,  and the Buddhist way of  life:\"In ordinary life, everything we do is serving our own interests, whereas in Vajrayana, we practice with selflessness. The path of  the Dharma does not have to be the same as the worldly path.\"(Yeshe Losal 2001:38)Of  course, this assessment can only be done from the outside. As a self-declared hybrid outsider,  i.e.  an  outsider  who  also  has  knowledge  of  those  who  (still)  live  in  the materialistic  world,  Yeshe  Losal  is  able  to  point  at  the  problems  of  the  \"Western people\":\"It is very difficult for Tibetan people to come here and start a European Sangha. Why would Tibetan Lamas actually come here to start a Sangha? In Asia there is a monastic tradition already so it is easy. When I was young I was just living like you. [...] I see now that my experience of  your culture was very meaningful and useful. I can now fill the gap and reach Western people, because I can understand what you're going through. - 58 -[...] If  I had been a monk all my life, if  I hadn't had any connection with the Western lifestyle, [...] I wouldn't be able to really help you very much.\" (Yeshe Losal 2001:32)Nevertheless,  \"Western lifestyle\" is  not the only 'other'  used as  a  reference point  in Yeshe  Losal's  narrative  about  Vajray\u0101na.  Since  his  construction  is  not  \"so  much  a religion\" (2001:1) but techniques for \"the mind\", he needs to demarcate his approach from other  'technical' approaches:\"Right  now  in  the  world,  there  are  many  schools  and  many  individuals  teaching meditation but their aims seem to be very limited. Their main purpose[s] seem to be to find inner peace, or [...] good experiences [...]. Actually this type of  meditation doesn't help you at all, on the contrary, it makes your life more miserable.\" (Yeshe Losal 2001:37)\"Buddhism has many methods to calm the mind and Tibetan Buddhism in particular has a wealth of  techniques that are unique and profound. The speciality of  Vajrayana is that  we  are  not  trying  to  by-pass  our  emotional  turmoil,  have  some sort  of  little peaceful time and that's all.\" (Yeshe Losal 2001:38)Here, it  becomes clear that Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' still  needs to operate within the relational  framework  of  'Buddhism'  to  not  become  solely  a  range  of  products  for 'spiritual well-being'. As for most agents who participate in the discourse on Buddhism, the actual difficulty for Yeshe Losal is to situate his construct within what he (being also involved in interfaith matters) generally perceives as the public discourse on Buddhism. Structurally speaking, his strategy resembles the approach chosen by the Japanese delegates to the World's Parliament of  Religions in 1893. For them the task was to relate  their  own  interests  to  the  framework  shaped  by  Euro-American  discourses  on Buddhism, which then favoured a 'Pali-source-Buddhism', as Judith Snodgrass points out in her analysis:\"They needed to show that Japanese Buddhism encompassed all of  the truth of  the Theravada \u2013 that is, all those aspects of  Buddhism which had attracted contemporary Western approval  \u2013  but  that  Theravada,  Southern Buddhism, was no more than a provisional and introductory expression of  the Buddha's teachings, which were more completely expressed in the Mahayana texts, and specifically in Buddhism as it  had been developed in Japan. For the delegates to Chicago addressing a Western audience, this  also  involved  dissociating  Japanese  Buddhism  from  the  then  much  maligned Nothern Buddhism, the Mahayana of  the Himalayan regions.  Eastern Buddhism, a term coined for the occasion, was the culmination of  Sakyamuni's teaching, and the most suitable candidate for the universal religion of  the future.\"(Snodgrass 2003:9-10)- 59 -Of  course,  time  has  changed  and the  \"much maligned  Northern  Buddhism\"  is  no longer defamed but 'ancient wisdom', distributed by 'globe-trotting' lamas. Nevertheless, Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' needs a distinctive place within the plurality of  Buddhist groups and approaches. Therefore, terms such as 'Tibetan Buddhism' or 'Vajray\u0101na' create the necessary  space  wherein the  Samy\u00e9 Ling community  can operate.  This  may also be illustrated by Akong Rinpoche's  response to the question of  how much of  Tibetan 'culture' is actually contained in Tibetan Buddhism:\"I don't think it matters very much. [...] From the Buddhist view, the Buddha taught many different techniques - 84,000 different teachings - in order to help different sorts of  people. Tibetan Buddhism passes on to us these teachings on how to help and how to benefit. [...] Every teaching - all 84,000 - contains something positive and the Tibetan approach, the Vajrayana approach, is included [i]n these. But the presentation doesn't really matter.\"(Akong Rinpoche 2007; emphasis added)Thus, the \"Tibetan approach\" becomes a question of  style, a representation of  mental techniques  which  have  been  passed  on  to  humankind  through  the  centuries.  This lineage-aspect  of  Samy\u00e9  Ling  'Buddhism'  is  particularly  important  in  that  it  clearly highlights the position of  the personal teacher, in contrast to, e.g., simply reading about  Buddhism or performing an online-ritual for becoming a Buddhist (see Lee [1999]2004):\"Lineage means that you have to have the lineage of  transmission. Lineage of transmission  means  that  the  transmission  of  the  ceremony does  not  pass through tape recorders, nor through radio or television but from human to human, person to person. When the teacher who gives you Refuge does so in the lineage, then you can trace your own receiving of  Refuge, from teacher to student, right back over two and a half  thousand years, from this country to Tibet, from Tibet to India, unbroken, right back to the Lord Buddha himself\"(Akong Rinpoche 2007; 1997) 3.3.3 The wider Samy\u00e9 Ling discourse on Buddhism\"In fact, the Tibetan language contained no word for Buddhism. Tibetans, traditionally, did not think of  themselves as Buddhist [...]. The West, with its systematic accounts, has played a significant role in the invention of  Buddh-ism, as opposed to the religion practiced by those who follow the religion of  the Buddha,  and whose beliefs  and rituals merge indefinably into their local folk customs.\" (Bishop 1993:17; emphasis in original)During my fieldwork in Scotland, the tension between a 'western' systematic view of  Buddhism versus  a 'Tibetan way of  life' view, as implicated by Peter Bishop above, has  - 60 -often been apparent to me. Community members, ordained and non-ordained, seem to have two different methods of  interpreting the teachings by Akong Rinpoche and Yeshe Losal,  especially  when  it  comes  to  \"Tibetan  mythology\".  Some  take  a  Buddhist modernist stand and dissociate themselves from such narratives by using phrases such as \"what  the  Tibetans  say\"  or  \"according  to  traditional  Tibetan  mythology\". 30 Others accept the narratives as elements of  the 48,000 teachings of  the Buddha, all contained within  Tibetan  Buddhism  but  universal  and  independent  from  Tibetan  cultural influences:\"Although the Tibetans did  an excellent  job of  codifying and commenting on the Buddhism of  India, they added little to its actual content. Tibetan Buddhism should not be seen as some exotic backwater of  Buddhism, as some might expect, but as the cream of  Buddhism, in its most complete form found anywhere in the world. Within its manifold teachings, one finds all that is found separately elsewhere as Theravada, Zen etc. as well as many teachings that only remained extant in Tibet.\"(Holmes 2007b)Here, Kenneth Holmes, a long-term member and teacher of  Samy\u00e9 Ling, reproduces  the myth of  Tibet  as  a  pristine conservator  of  Buddhadharma to solve a  common problem of  'Buddhism' in Europe: the plurality of  Buddhisms. Thus, Tibetan Buddhism becomes  the  \"most  complete  form\",  encompassing  all  teachings  of  other Buddhadharma-containers \u2013 as Saym\u00e9 Ling's offical website clearly states:\"There are three different levels of  Buddhist teaching and practice [...]. The first level is  the  Hinayana  or  'Basic  Vehicle';  the  second  level  is  the  Mahayana  or  'Greater Vehicle';  and  the  third  is  the  Vajrayana  or  'Indestructible  Vehicle'.  [...]  Sometimes people  mistakenly  believe  that  they  are  different  sects  of  Buddhism  that  are  in opposition to one other. This is not correct. They are all interrelated parts of  a single body of  teachings given by the Buddha over his lifetime. All three vehicles have been preserved within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"(Kagyu Samye Ling 2007)The \"Tibetan Buddhist tradition\", therefore, is not universal because it is (just) another  form  of  universal  Buddhism  but  because  it  has  preserved  the  universality  of  the Buddhadharma in its entirety.  Peter  Bishop (1993:83) holds that such arguments are expressions of  the myth of  the spiritual superiority of  'the East', i.e.  'the East' as the treasury  of  'ancient  wisdom'.  According  to  Bishop,  this  particular  myth  has  been extended to  the  version  that  'the  East'  already  had  what  'western  science'  has  only 30 Nevertheless, no-one I talked to questioned the historical existence of  past lineage holders of  the Karma Kagy\u00fc lineage.- 61 -recently discovered: the philosophical dimension of  Quantum physics, particle physics,  astronomy,  etc.  were  already  encompassed  in  'Eastern'  thought  (Bishop  1993:84). During my fieldwork, I was often confronted with narratives building upon this myth:  \"Einstein's  [special]  theory  of  relativity\",  \"Quantum  physics\"  and  so  on,  became (unexplained) terms which my Samy\u00e9 Ling class 'teachers' used in order to authorise, for instance, narratives about \"emptiness\". It was assumed that everybody was familiar with the implications of  the theories behind such terms, and that everybody placed trust in and gave authority to such knowledge.As Bishop (1993:85-86) has pointed out,  such constructions have two sides: first, Buddhist doctrine is rationally legitimised by translating it into scientific vocabulary; and  second, science is constructed as an object, rather than an ongoing process. What is more,  the  myth  of  a  scientific  Buddhism has  produced  concepts  such  as  \"spiritual technology\",  corresponding  to  the  \"mechanical  technology\"  achieved  by  'the  West' (Bishop  1993:84). Akong  Rinpoche's  and  Yeshe  Losal's  language  also  contain  such mechanistic  metaphors  (e.g.  \"technique\")  and   'psychologised'  concepts  (\"therapy\").  These reflect the impact and success of  'scientific Buddhism' and other narratives, such as Buddhism as a \"mind science\" or \"religion of  reason\", on 'Tibetan Buddhism' (cf.  Lopez 1998:38, 77, 168). To  illustrate one of  these 'techniques', we can turn to Akong Rinpoche's \"Visualising the Sky-Blue Light Overcoming Stupidity\" exercise:\"Look within your mind and see where there is complacency, dullness and stupidity. See  its  manifestations  in  your  day-to-day  life  and  all  its  effects,  both  physical  and emotional. [...] This blue light streaming in makes it possible to identify, understand, accept and let go of  these feelings, which are then transformed into a dark-blue smoke that dissolves one foot away from the body. [...] At the end of  the session, after feeling that the dullness and stupidity is washed away, let the light got out first to those you know and then to all others. Then visualise the blue light returning to the sphere.\" (Akong Rinpoche 1994:175)This  therapy  exercise  is  one  element  of  a  larger  programme,  developed  by  Akong Rinpoche for a wider public. The programme, which comes with a strictly structured timetable (cf. 1994:97), is just one of  many provided by Akong Rinpoche. Holmes  is  another  example  of  the  mechanistic  'metaphorisation'  of  \"Tibetan teachings\"; he compares the lineage with a key that opens the door to the experience of compassion:- 62 -\"We have a pure lineage through time, where the whole meaning, and in a depth of this practice, has been maintained through the centuries until Akong Rinpoche and the other masters today, who hold it. Now, amongst other things, they hold a key. We all have compassion, and the potential for compassion, within ourselves. But somehow when you receive empowerment,  (jick),  it  opens  up the key.  So when you do the practice, it actually bears fruit. And if  you did the same technique and practice without the empowerment, somehow it doesn't work so well. This is why we need to receive an empowerment from a pure lineage and a good lineage master.\"(Holmes 2007a)This excerpt from Holmes' lecture reflects a major tendency in Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism'. The  power  of  the  lineage,  imagined  as  a  key,  the  power  of  the  Tibetan  language, encompassing  the  mental  achievements  of  past  masters,  and  the  healing  effects  of Tibetan texts  are  all  frequently  repeated elements  in  the  narratives  upheld by  those Samy\u00e9 Ling community members I met and whose works I read. They all operate in a  mechanistic picture, pointing to the same claim: that it works.\"Actually, the bottom line is that it works. It's like my telephone number; I won't give it you, but if  you had it, you just go beep,  [...] beep, beep, and I'm on the other end. [...] You dial any other number, you won't get me. You dial that number, you're through to me. When we set our mind in the way that these visionaries have seen, and we use our imagination and our prayers and many other things in the right way, it attunes us to a compassion that we never experienced before.\"(Holmes 2007a) 3.3.4 DiscussionHaving  introduced  parts  of  Samye  Ling  'Buddhism',  I  would  like  to  highlight  two aspects I regard as particularly important for its construction: (1) The existence of  \"fantasies\" and \"imaginations\" (Bishop 199331;  Lopez 1998) about Tibet,  Tibetan Buddhism, ancient wisdom, powerful  lamas,  etc.,  which have  been  cultivated  in  Scotland  (and  other  countries)  and  which  are continuously  nourished  and  conserved  by  public  media,  scholars  and  Tibet romantics.(2) Akong  Rinpoche's  and  Yeshe  Losal's  self-perception,  gained  through  their socialisation as religious elites in Tibet and India and reinforced by their exile situation: namely, to really represent and embody Tibet and to be truly leading  figures of  a genuinely 'Tibetan way of  life'.31 Bishop uses the term \"fantasy\" as a psychoanalytical term.- 63 -Without  aspect  one,  the  establishment  of  and  support  for   Samy\u00e9  Ling is  hard  to imagine. Supposedly, in Europe there are hundreds or thousands refugees, from all over the  world,  who  postulate  knowledge  about  \"non-falsifiable  realities\"  (Cox  2007:83), healing techniques, ancient wisdom and non-worldly but spiritual ways of  life. I would like to argue that European 'fantasies' about Tibet function as a selective process, or  'selection pressure', and privilege some narrators of  spiritual stories over others. Indeed,  as the case of  Samy\u00e9 Ling suggests,  if  positive imaginations towards the 'Tibetan Way' are not present, not only indifference but even negative reactions may arise. As Andy Murray reports, locals from Dumfriesshire, the area where Samy\u00e9 Ling  monastery was built, have not always been sympathetic to the plans of  the Samy\u00e9 Ling  community, fearing that the Tibetans might \"tak[e] over the valley by stealth\", \"impos[e] an alien culture\" and buy \"every possible square inch of  land in  the area\" (Murray  1989:41). Furthermore,  a  'selection  process'  had  taken  place  even  prior  to  the  arrival  of Tibetans in the UK. Englishwoman Gelongma Palmo (Freda Bedi)  had not only taught  Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa  and Akong Rinpoche  English  and educated  them in  her  Young Lamas Home School in Delhi, but she had also helped to organise their trip to England and Trungpa's scholarship for the University of  Oxford.32 Certainly, one may ask why an English  woman  in  the  1960s  would  choose  to  particularly  support  young  Tibetan religious specialists. What is more, Christmas Humphreys' fascination with the Tibetan situation  had  been  an  important  factor  why  he  met  Ch\u00f6gyam  Trungpa  in  Tibet  (Humphreys 1968:61-62, 68, 80) and provided the Tibetan immigrants with a forum for  their construction of  'Tibetan Buddhism' in the context of  the English Buddhist scene  of  the 1960s.However, without aspect two, all  European imagination would have been without direct object and therefore less powerful. Both Akong Rinpoche and his brother were educated within the Tibetan monastic system after  Akong had been recognised as a tulku. Therefore, they have been exposed to narratives of  religious elite and leadership from a young age. This is particularly interesting since Bishop (1993:96) reminds us that  \"[w]hen Tibetan Buddhism came to the West, only a fraction of  this religious structure, this  social  network  of  spiritual  power,  made  the  journey.\"  According  to  Bishop 32 Rawlinson 1997:181-182; Fugard 1984:40; Gimian 2004:xxiii.- 64 -(1993:93),  narratives  about  Tibetan  Buddhism  actually  became  narratives  about  the monastic  system  \u2013  as  is  also  demonstrated  by  Yeshe  Losal's  wish  for  creating  a European sangha (2001:32).Indeed,  Samy\u00e9 Ling narratives about Tibetan Buddhism hardly reflect more plurality than  acknowledging  the  so-called  four  main  schools  of  'Tibetan  Buddhim'33. For instance, Pure Land beliefs, which Bishop (1993:87) testifies have a large popularity in Tibet, are not mentioned in the \"Tibetan teachings\" (Akong Rinpoche 1994). As Lopez remarks (1998:185), when the Tibetan refugees fled from Tibet and arrived in 'the West', 'Tibet' was already there. The task then was to enter the discourse on Tibet and  Buddhism as  the  actual  objects  of  the  discourse  and  to  give  it  shape  by  the authority  of  'the  native'.  In  a  way,  Kenneth  Holmes'  instructions  to  the  audience,  preceding  an  empowerment34 given  by  Akong  Rinpoche,  provide  a  metaphorical illustration and, at the same time, data about the process I have outlined above: the  meshing of  imaginative 'receptivity'  and the received 'internalisation' of  the myth of  lineage:\"So,  it's  an  empowerment  in  that  sense,  and the  way  the  empowerment  works,  is through your openness and receptivity, on your side, and through the fact that the lama who  gives  it  really  is  what  we  call  a  lineage  holder.  In  themselves  they  have  the realisation and they have received this transmission from their teacher, got it from his teacher, there is a pure unbroken line from the Buddha.\"(Holmes 2007a)My overall  impression is that the agents propagating Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' do not  attempt to create a new Buddhism, e.g., for the people in Scotland. Instead, they build on the idea that they provide Buddhism to the people in Scotland and elsewhere. 33 Nyimgmapa, Kagy\u00fcpa, Sakyapa and Gelugpa.34 An empowerment is an initiatory ritual for allowing (i.e. 'empowering') the student to study and practice, for instance, a particular text.- 65 - 3.4 Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' 3.4.1 Contextualising Wat Dhammapadipa narratives about BuddhismIn  reviewing  the  available  literature  I  have  found  scarce  academic  interest  in  the 'Buddhism' of  Thai Buddhists in Scotland and the UK in general. Whilst traditions such as the Thai Forest Sangha, which became popular for 'westerners' under the American-born Ajahn Sumedho, have received relatively more attention (e.g. Bluck 2006; Mellor  1989), studies on immigrants with a Thai Buddhist identity, such as Paul Numrich's  Old wisdom in the New World (1996), are rare. In fact, there is hardly any publicly available knowledge on even visible aspects such as the Thai wats in Britain (e.g. Oliver 1979; Humphreys 1968). In principle, to my knowledge, there are no larger studies on Thais in the UK, although the Runnymede Trust has recently launched a research project on British Thai communities.Therefore, my data for Wat Dhammapadipa comprises of  only selective information I  gained  whilst  conducting  fieldwork  with  the  'group'  and  from  their  leaflets  and websites. As I have no sufficient competence in the Thai language, my interviews with  and exploration of  the group have been significantly restricted. 35 However, I maintain that this very limited data is still interesting within the context of  how 'Buddhism' is constructed in Scotland. I shall therefore briefly introduce some of  my observations.Wat Dhammapadipa,  located in Edinburgh and often called Dhammapadipa Temple,  is the first and only Thai wat in Scotland, founded in 2003 and officially established in  Edinburgh as a charity in 2005. Scottish property regulations complicate the use of  the building  as  a temple;36 consequently,  Wat  Dhammpadipa  can  only  officially  provide housing for monks37.  Belonging to the Mahanikai38 of  Thailand, it is a branch of  the London Thai wat, Wat Buddhapadipa, which was established in 1965/66 (as Buddhapadipa Vihara)  with  the  help  of  the  Thai  government  and  which  has  been  presented  as Europe's only \"formal temple according to Thai tradition\" since 1982  (Buddhapadipa 35 Nevertheless, a journey to Thailand, of  which the monks were very supportive, and my own status as a foreigner in the UK helped me to become integrated within the 'group' to a certain extent.36 According to the Thai-Scottish Association, one would have to buy an old church building which could then be transformed into an official temple in Edinburgh.37 I use the term 'monk' for these religious specialists because they refer to themselves as 'monks'.38 Mahanikai, an umbrella school comprising various traditions, and Thammyutnikai constitute the two main schools in Thailand's institutionalised Buddhism.- 66 -2007, cf. Humphreys 1968:63). Both wats are considered to be branches of  the Bangkok Wat Mahathat (Yuwarajarangsarit Rajaworamahavihara).According to the Thai-Scottish Association (est. 1997), the wat functions as a cultural node,  keeping  the  c.  400-500  strong  Thai  community  in  Scotland  (and  Northern England) together. In general, there are significantly more females in the community.39 Furthermore,  I  was informed that  in consulation with Wat Buddhapadipa there had been  made  plans  in  2005  for   establishing  Wat  Dhammapadipa  since  the  distance between Scotland and London hindered many Thais in Scotland from attending Thai  festivals and ceremonies in Wat Buddhapadipa.At present, three monks live in the wat: (Phramaha) Visit Panyawatdhano, the 'abbot' of  Wat  Dhammapadipa, (Phramaha) Saworn  Sangvaro  and (Phramaha) Watana Yasawatdhano.  Like  all  Thai  monks  in  the  UK,  they  have  completed  a  special dhammaduta programme in Thailand, which allowed them to receive a four year visa. Therefore, they call themselves \"dhammaduta monks\" or \"missionary monks\". 39 The Thai-Scottish Association explains the higher proportion of  females as a result of  the strict entry modalities for the UK, although these can be bypassed by marriage. According to my informants, this is something considered by Thai women  deciding to marry British men (therefore, the name 'Thai-Scottish' Association).- 67 -Photograph 8: Wat Dhammapadipa - 'shrine' roomIn general, it is primarily the monks who produce narratives about Buddhism within the  Wat  Dhammapadipa  context.  They  offer  Sunday  classes  to  children  and adults, mainly to teach Thai and give religious instructions. Monks may also represent their 'Buddhism' outside the wat, for example, in the Dharma Society of  the University of Edinburgh (see 1.3.1). Aditionally, Wat Dhammapadipa runs its own website in Thai and partially in English, distributes  leaflets  (Thai  and English),  books  and booklets from teachers that have been ordained in Thai Buddhist traditions, for instance, Ajahn Chah.Furthermore, following the community's  first public fund-raising events (e.g.  Thai dancing)  the  local  media has shown interest  in  the  plans to build  a  Thai  style  wat. However, as far as I can see, the degree of  influence of  Wat Dhammapadipa narratives  on the public reception of  Buddhism has been nominal  at best. 3.4.2 'Buddhism' in Wat Dhammapadipa\"[T]o the Thai nation as a whole, Buddhism has been the main spring from which flow its culture and philosophy, its are and literature, its ethics and morality and many of  its folkways and festivals.\"(Kusalasaya 2001:23)This quote is taken from a book I found in a Bangkok book store and which is aimed at a non-Thai readership (supposedly, at a Lankan and Indian readership). It may serve as an illustration of  the discourse on Buddhism I encountered at Wat Dhammapadipa, maintained  both  by  the  monks  and  the  lay  people. Indeed,  one  of  my informants explained the character of  the Thai community this way: \"As Thai, we are tied together  with culture, custom and religion, especially Buddhism; so with those, we come together everywhere we are.\"In fact, this 'we' and 'coming together' are major elements in Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism'  \u2013  the  wat  is  primarily  presented  as  a  cultural  centre  where  the  Thai community can meet. Indeed, whilst Europeans may wish to categorise Thai boxing as sport, Thai flags and photographies of  the royal family as civil religion and the monks  as maintainers of  Buddhism, for the Thais there is only one thing: a wat. Furthermore,  in  direct  conversation  or  in  'class'  the  monks  did  not  necessarily construct Buddhism as a system. The term 'Buddhism' was only used to classify certain - 68 -beliefs and behaviour. The actual overall-category was Buddha-dharma, the teachings of the Buddha. Therefore, besides chanting, blessings and vipassana meditation,  I  mostly heard stories from the Pali canon, almost like in the genre of  a Bildungsroman, or was introduced to the Thai Forest tradition of  Ajahn Chah. The talks I heard were  different from talks in the FWBO and Saym\u00e9 Ling community in that the monks did not attempt  to interpret the content by using 'scientific' or 'psychologised' metaphors. 40 By contrast, logical fallacies in a text were not addressed or  even noticed. Rather, the importance of practice, i.e. the studying of  texts and meditation, was emphasised.Another aspect of  Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' also captured my attention: apart from some information about the history of  Wat Dhammapadipa, all material was in English. Moreover,  most  of  the  material  at  Wat  Dhammapadipa  has  not  been manufactured by Wat Dhammapadipa or Wat Buddhapadipa, but instead has been mass-produced in Thailand and can also easily be found, for instance, in Bangkok. I suppose that the reason why some material is distributed and multiplied so often is to do with language:  it  is  English.  In  fact,  at  present,  the  representation  of  Buddhism outside Thailand  is  much  dependent  upon  English  speakers.  However,  this  dependency  on English speakers, who in the UK context are mainly British, may function as a filter for the way in which the topic 'Buddhism' is addressed. The following two quotes, taken from Buddhapadipa's  official  website  and the Basic Buddhism Guide distributed at  Wat Dhammapadipa,  illustrate  the  type  of  content   found  in  these  English  language materials.\"Buddhism is different from many other religions in several ways. For example, there is no Buddhist god or creator.\"(Lake 2006)\"Science is knowledge which can be made into a system, which depends on seeing and testing facts  and stating general  natural  laws.  The core  of  Buddhism fits  into this definition, because the Four Noble truths [...] can be tested and proven by anyone.\"(White 1993)The above quotes reveal a modernist discourse shining through these narratives about Buddhism,  as  has  already  been  observed  in  FWBO  and  Samy\u00e9  Ling  'Buddhism'. Buddhism is scientific and without a god. We may ask: Whom does this information 40 As I learnt from one monk, who told me his biography, many Thai monks are recruited from the rural areas of  Thailand, where farming is more important than education. Nevertheless, in the monastic educational system, studying for Pali degrees is, of  course, much more important than studying European 'science' and its structure of  argumentation.- 69 -address? If  there is no god in Buddhism, why should a Buddhist be concerned with the issue of  god(s)? Indeed, these English quotes target people socialised in 'the West'. Thai  narratives cannot simply enter the public discourse on Buddhism, which is maintained  and preserved in English concepts  and language;  therefore,  it  is  these English texts  which eventually publicly present 'Thai Therav\u0101da Buddhism' in the UK and Scotland. However, the distribution of  talismans and the interaction between monks and spirits  are neglected, even though such activities equally represent the realities of  practising Buddhists within the same Thai Therav\u0101da Buddhist group.Paul Numrich, in his study of  American Therav\u0101da Buddhist temples,  has called this phenomenon  \"parallel  congregations\"  (1996:63).  This  means  that  two  groups  of Buddhists, whose understanding of  Buddhism differs significantly, practice under the same roof,  but are separate in terms of  space (different rooms) and time (different weekends). For instance, whilst one group may engage more in what Numrich calls a \"ceremonial from of   Theravada Buddhism\" the other group may be more concerned with  the  \"philosophical  and  meditative  form\"  (1996:76).  Numrich  (1996:70)  also observed that the separation occurred along 'ethnic' and linguistic lines. Leaflets even  advertised  some  events  for  \"English  Speaking  Friends\"  and  others  for  \"Thai  and Laotian Friends\".Nevertheless, the groups are united through the focus on the religious specialists: the monks. In the case of  Wat Dhammapadipa, one Christian Thai explained that the role of  the monks is so interwoven with everyday life in Thai 'culture' that most Christians, even though they may have been told at school not to do so, will accept the wat as nexus for ceremonies and exchange with other Thais. In fact, the focus on the wat is so strong, that the Thais I interviewed were not aware of  any other Buddhist groups in Scotland or nearby. Some Thais knew of  other Thai Buddhist  institutions  in  the  rest  of  the  UK but  even the monks had only heard of Samy\u00e9 Ling. Thus, there are no links between Wat Dhammapadipa and other groups, even though the FWBO's Edinburgh Buddhist Centre lists it on its website. When I  asked for the reasons, the Thai-Scottish Association and one monk explained that they had been contacted by some groups; however, they rejected the offers to participate in networks  and  contribute  to  interfaith  events.  As  I  found  out,  these  reactions  were mainly related to  language difficulties and particular perceptions of  Islam in Thailand. - 70 -The monks did not wish to get involved in discussions on faith and feared they may be asked about their views of  Islam. Therefore,  an  awareness  of  the  pluralistic  Buddhist  scene  in  Scotland  and  the resultant pressure to position Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' within this pluralistic field, is currently not present. Indeed, I found nothing more in Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' than the distinction between Therav\u0101da and Mahay\u0101na \u2013 which in their final assessment, as I was told, are not separate but belong together.  3.4.3 DiscussionAs noted above, Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' is mainly delivered by dhammaduta monks, who have undergone a special  programme in Thailand prior to their arrival.  According to Somboon Suksamran (1977:67), Thailand's sangha had been subject to the political modernisation process of  the 1960s \u2013 or as Charles Keyes put it:\"[T]he  very  success  of  the  integrative  revolution  of  Culalongkorn  made  the  Thai Sangha a national structure of  such significance that the temptation to use it for such purposes has in recent years become irresistible.\"(Keyes 1971:559)Thus, Thailand's  government established several  modernisation  programmes  in  the 1960s.  One  of  these  programmes  was  the phra  thammath\u016bt programme  (from  Pali dhammaduta, 'dhamma ambessador'), which was launched in the 1960s to strengthen the position of  Buddhism as a unifying ideology for Thailand's plural population. Thailand's political elite had been afraid of  the communist ideology undermining the foundation of the  nation-state  (Suksamran  1977:93-94).  Therefore,  the thammath\u016bt programme was initiated  to  train  selected  monks  who  were  then  sent  to  the  respective  districts  of  Thailand to provide villagers with food and medicine and to teach them Buddhism. Of course, the agenda underpinning this programme has changed since the 1960s; however, as far as I could deduce from my interviews, the procedure has remained highly selective and competitive.Therefore, the term 'dhammaduta' reminds us that the narratives about Buddhism which arrive via the monks in Scotland have already been filtered. This, of  course, is not  exceptional,  but  particularly  obvious  in  the  case  of  Wat  Dhammapadipa  (and  Wat - 71 -Buddhapadipa). The interplay between the Thai sangha, Thai governmental structures and UK visa  regulations  result  in  a  distinct  pattern for  the  selection of  missionary monks. Thus, there are only Mahanikai monks in Scotland, but not, for instance, monks from the controversial Dhammak\u0101ya temple (cf. Scott 2006:226-227). Furthermore, at Wat Dhammapadipa, Thai flags and photographies of  Thai royals are omnipresent. One monk also described Thailand as \"the land of  the Buddha\" and was visibly glad to have been incarnated there. This, of  course, is not remarkable in itself.  Why should there not be any national  symbols  or national  pride? However,  I regard this, in combination with the dhammaduta selection procedure, as expressions of  the nationalist narrative of  what constitutes Thailand or the 'invention of  Thai-ness' (cf.  Keyes 1995:150). This means that in Thailand there is a centralised force determining what  counts  as  Buddhism  and  what  does  not;  and  this  force,  institutionalised  for instance in the form of  the thammath\u016bt programme, also determines which narratives about  Buddhism eventually  arrive  in  Scotland as  'Thai  Buddhist  tradition'  or  (Thai)  'Therav\u0101da'.What is more, the case of  Wat Dhammapadipa illustrates that the financial situation, education and social capital of  a group are major factors in directing which narratives may successfully enter the public discourse on Buddhism. Limited resources, language barriers and  a mere concentration on the Thai community results in low visibility. To slightly overstate my argument: School classes may prefer to visit Samy\u00e9 Ling, where a native  English  speaker  is  able  to  present   Buddhism as  a  system,  more  or  less  in accordance with their religious education textbooks, rather than to listen to an allegedly  exotic 'dhamma-talk' in broken English at Wat Dhammapadipa.Overall, I would like to characterise Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' as based upon six pillars: (1) a nationalist conception of  Buddhism, which continuously re-constructs  Thai  identity  \u2013  far  away  from geographical  Thailand;  (2)  anchored  in  a  lay/monk-dichotomy;  (3)  encompassing  'magical'/  talisman  elements  and,  therefore,  entirely dependent on the presence of  religious specialists,  who distribute such elements; (4)  modernist tendencies; (5) susceptible to forming a 'parallel congregation' (Numrich) and (6) very restricted in its influence on the public discourse on Buddhism.- 72 - 4 Conclusions 4.1 Mechanisms in the construction of  'Buddhism' in Scotland4.1.1 The diversity of   narratives about Buddhism in ScotlandThroughout this study, I have been drawing together accounts which, in one way or another, contribute to the discourse on Buddhism. Besides scholarly accounts, I selected three (institutionalised) discourses on Buddhism, which I had found coexisting within a spatially  graspable  region,  Scotland.  All  three  share  a  common  feature:  they  are embedded  in  a  Buddhist  modernist  discourse  (see  4.2.2);  i.e.,  the  construction  of Buddhism (principally) as a religious or spiritual endeavour, which does not need the concept  of  god  or  gods,  which  emphasises  meditation  and  provides  a  narrative framework for shaping personal identity. Moreover, I found that 'western' Buddhists, primarily in the FWBO but also in the Samy\u00e9 Ling community,  tend to communicate their narratives of  Buddhism on the basis of  metaphors of  psychological states and (spiritual) techniques. One may regard this  as  another  expression  of  the  Buddhist  modernist  discourse,  which  represents Buddhist practice as \"a rational attempt to alter our perception and response to the world, rather than a 'magical' attempt to alter the world as such\" (Sharf  1995:267). Both Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' and FWBO 'Buddhism' are modelled upon what Robert Sharf (1995:269)  described  as  a  distinction   between  experience  as  a  \"superior  form  of  knowledge\" and \"'second-hand' knowledge\" (e.g. knowledge from texts). By contrast, at Wat Dhammapadipa, certain blessing rituals and the selling of  talismans appear to be more 'magical'.Of  course, the groups' narratives differ also in other respects. FWBO 'Buddhism', as a  grandchild  of  Humphrey's  theosophical  'Buddhism',  encompasses  the  notion  of \"ecumenical\" Buddhism, whereas Samy\u00e9 Ling 'Buddhism' stresses tradition and lineage \u2013 which is  now (also)  open for 'westerners'.  The Thai community,  however,  already 'possesses' Buddhism, which is seen as native to Thai culture. This  is also reflected in rituals aimed at establishing Buddhist identity: both the Samy\u00e9 Ling community, in their refuge ceremonies for 'converts', and the FWBO, in their ordination ceremonies, give their members new Tibetan, Sanskrit and Pali names. By contrast,  such rituals do not exist at Wat Dhammapadipa and even senior European members of  the Lay Buddhist  Association of  Wat Buddhapadipa (still) use 'European' names.11 The FWBO creates unique composite nouns using Sanskrit and Pali terms for their new WBO members' names. When asked why she uses a Sanskrit name, a FWBO member turned the tables - 74 -What  is  more,  as  has  been  shown,  Samy\u00e9  Ling  'Buddhism'  includes  the  idea  of preserving the (old) 'Tibetan Way' and what is considered to be \"the most complete form  of  Buddhism\"  (see  3.3.3).  Similarly,  but  in  in  a  different  context,  Wat Dhammapadipa 'Buddhism' preserves what the community considers to be essential to Thai  culture  and  thus  provides  a  framework  for  creating  a  network  for  Thais  in Scotland.  Samy\u00e9  Ling  and  Wat  Dhammapadipa  offer  Buddhism to 'the  West'.  The FWBO, however,  does not have another 'culture'.  Since FWBO 'Buddhism' is  based upon the construct of  'western culture',  members have to change their own culture. They  do  not  simply  offer  Buddhism  to  'the  West',  but  they  attempt  to  integrate Buddhism into 'the West'.Moreover, there is a diversity of  activities which can be justified by the respective constructions of  Buddhism \u2013 as illustrated in the table below.2 Group Wat Dhammapadipa Samy\u00e9 Ling FWBO ScotlandActivity Money tree Chanting in Tibetan; Tibetan names for membersCeltic pujaPoint of referencefor the activityThai Buddhism; merit-making through the donation of moneyVajray\u0101na Buddhism; the energy of  great teachers prevails in the Tibetan languageWestern Buddhism; the universal dharma can be injected in any cultureLegitimising narrative Thailand is the land of  Buddhism; therefore, Thai Buddhism is a pure and important form of  BuddhismVajray\u0101na Buddhism is the highest form of  Buddhism encompassing all other BuddhismsAs shown throughout history, the dharma is universal and not dependent on cultural baggage. Sangharakshita has identified and applied this core to Western cultureTable 2: Diversity of  Buddhist activities in ScotlandFor instance,  a  'Celtic  puja'  (as  conducted by  members  of  the  FWBO) is  hardly imaginable  in  Wat  Dhammapadipa  'Buddhism'.  Thai  culture is Buddhist  culture; therefore,  no  special  relationship  between  'culture' and  'religion' needs  to  be constructed. On the other hand, if  taking an FWBO approach to Buddhism, one does not need to believe in the energy of  Tibetan prayers and chants or the preservation of this energy in the Tibetan language, for the dharma is thought to be transferable to non-asking why she should use a \"Christian name\"; as a Buddhist, she consequently should have a \"Buddhist name\".2 The table is based on my fieldwork findings of  the three groups.- 75 -Asian culture. Moreover, the Samy\u00e9 Ling community is engaged in interfaith activities and  experienced  in  fund-raising  campaigns,  in  contrast  to  Wat  Dhammapadipa; therefore, the community  is not solely dependent on its members' belief  in d\u0101na3. Another difference is how effectively groups can anchor their narrative of  Buddhism in the public discourse on Buddhism. As seen, the FWBO is highly professionalised in influencing the public discourse on Buddhism. The Samy\u00e9 Ling community, has also been very successful while working within the Scottish interfaith network. 4 For instance, they were able to raise huge funds for their activities in Edinburgh; according to Vallely  (2006), Kwik-Fit owner Tom Farmer supports the project for a large interfaith centre in Edinburgh, whose ground floor will be for the Samy\u00e9 Ling community. Apparently, only Buddhist  groups  who are  sympathetic  towards  interfaith  ideology  will  make  use  of  structures such as the interfaith network of  the Scottish Inter Faith Council. However, if  a  group  does  not  want  to  engage  with  other  'faith  groups',  as  the  case  of  Wat Dhammapadipa  demonstrates,  it  is  less  likely  for  that  group  to  gain  access  to  the  resources provided by governmental-supported interfaith structures and it is less likely to anchor its 'Buddhism' in the public discourse. Overall, the public discourse on Buddhism, which thus is both a product of  as well as a 'guideline' for the respective Buddhist group narratives in Scotland, may be outlined referring to the following three important characteristics: (1) Buddhism is a (peaceful)  religion, with high moral standards,5 amongst other religions.6 (2) The notion of  god(s) must be downplayed. (3) Buddhism, healing the ('western') wound between religion and science, is modern, scientific, rational and concerned with 'the mind'. On  the  other  hand,  the  diversity  of  approaches  and  narratives  found  within contemporary 'Buddhism' in Scotland illustrates the interplay between 'junior' narratives conserved in the respective Buddhist groups and the function of  the public discourse: everything is possible, but not everything is (currently) imaginable and communicable.3 The belief  in d\u0101na means a belief  that generosity, donations, etc. have a positive effect on the  donor \u2013 in terms of  merit as well as character transformation.4 The Scottish Inter Faith Council has direct contact with Scotland's First Minister, which resulted, for instance, in the Time for Reflection ritual in the Scottish parliament (see also Sutcliffe  2004b)5 'Moral' is defined here in terms of  the norms system prevalent in Scotland. The perception of Buddhism as closely corresponding to, or even exceeding, such norms can be deduced from the reaction, for instance, by the media, when Buddhist groups transgress the borders of  prevalent norms. For example, see reactions to sexual misconduct in the FWBO movement (Bluck 2006:187; Bunting 1996) or in the Samy\u00e9 Ling community (Mendick 2000:13; Meredith 2000:10).6 Since Buddhism has the status of  a religion, a Buddhist group can present itself  more widely than, for example, a Yoga group.- 76 -4.1.2 'Buddhism' contrasted: the case of   IndonesiaThe  structures  underpinning  the  construction  of  'Buddhism'  in  Scotland  become particularly visible when we contrast narratives in Scotland, not only with each other but also with a very different construct found in Indonesia.Scholars such as Edith Franke (e.g. 2005a, 2006) and Iem Brown (e.g. 1987, 2004) have shed light on the shaping of  a monotheistic 'Buddhism'. Franke (2006:72) identifies ideas of  religious and national  harmony and the state ideology of pancasila as major causes  of  its  construction.  In  short,  the pancasila ('five  principles') is  a  compromise between 'secularists' and advocates of  a Muslim state, who were both involved in the formation  of  Indonesia  in  1949  (Franke  2006:70,  77).  Strongly influenced  by  the dominance of  Muslim identities in Indonesia, it encompasses (1) belief  in the one and only  god,7 (2)  a  just  and  civilised  humanity,  (3)  Indonesia's  unity,  (4)  (pancasila) democracy and (5) social justice.8 Since  the pancasila is not institutionalised law but a state philosophy, it is propagated in educational institutions and consistently developed. Therefore,  the pancasila may  be  regarded  as  a  civic-religious,  muslim-nationalistic discourse that has created a particular 'selection pressure'9 on Buddhist groups. This selection pressure strengthened Buddhist groups such as the movement around the  Indonesian  bhikkhu  Ashin  Jinarrakhita.  To  comply  with  the pancasila ideology, Jinarrakhita's Buddhayana movement produced a distinct discourse on Sang Hyang Adi Buddha (Brown 1987:111), who was constructed as the highest god of  Buddhism \u2013 as the group's explanation of  the \u0100di Buddha principle demonstrates:\"1. The One Supreme God is Adi Buddha    2. The Prophets are Buddha Gotama and the Bodhisattvas   3. The Holy Books are 1) Tipitaka            2) Dhammapada [...]           3) Sang Hyang Kamahayanikan\"(Brown 1987:113; emphasis in original)However, not all Indonesian Buddhist groups necessarily agreed with this principle; for  instance, one Therav\u0101da group proposed nirvana as the highest principle of  Buddhism (Franke 2005a:396).  Nevertheless,  all  debates pursued the framework of pancasila and 7 The term used is ketuhanan and has been preferred to allah since it refers to an abstract concept of  a 'supreme god', which was to allow non-Muslim and non-Christian groups to also identify with the first sila (Franke 2005a:392-393).8 Cf. Republic of  Indonesia: http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/index.php/content/view/112/336/, accessed 30/09/2007.9 I.e., a directed force onto a group which presses the development of  this group in a particular direction (see 2.2.4).- 77 -nativistic  concepts  of  'Indonesian  Buddhism',  which  under  nationalistic  pressure  \u2013 similar to the Meiji-Japanese discourse on Buddhism \u2013 attempted at viewing Buddhism  as  something  not  imported  but  genuinely  Indonesian  (Brown  2004:53).  This  brief example  from Indonesia  reminds  us  that  it  is  the  negotiated  framework,  the  actual discursive environment, mirroring the concerns of  those in power, which shapes the categories and thinking patterns in which other participants in the discourse are situated.Of  course, this mechanism is not restricted to the discourse on Buddhism, but is a common feature of  constructing religious identities, as is demonstrated, for instance, by Harjot  Oberoi's  analysis  of  Sikh  identities  (1997[1994]).  His  work  investigates  the  interplay between British colonial rule and the Tat Khalsa group within the Singh Sabha  movement,  which  under  colonio-administrative  selection  pressure  in  19th  century Punjab transformed loose Sikh identities into (re)-defined Khalsa Sikh identities (Oberoi  1997[1994]:24-25, 71, 424-425; Fenech 2003:148, 150). Translated into the case of  Scotland, this means that those Buddhist groups which meet the reference points of  a prevailing discursive framework (i.e. 'Buddhism') will \u2013 in the  long term \u2013  succeed  in  (1)  qualifying  as  representatives  of  Buddhism and  (2) gaining the power to reproduce and shape 'Buddhism' within a  Brede-Kristensenian society, where the believer is always right.10 Hence, groups which do not meet the expectations of  the public discourse will either  have  to  invent  and  \u2013  with  much  effort  \u2013  promote  new  reference  points,  which sufficiently  broaden the  public  discourse  for  the  inclusion of  their  views, 11 or  such groups will experience immense public pressure, as is demonstrated, for instance, by the case of  the New Kadampa Tradition in the UK (Kay 2004:44-52; Bluck 2006:131-132), which  received  extremely  negative  media  coverage  when criticising  the  Dalai  Lama. Furthermore,  such  pressure  might  lead  to  the  lack  of  funding  and,  finally,  to  the  diminishing of  the group. Indeed,   the \u0100di  Buddha construct  is  at  present  not  thinkable  within the  public discourse  on  Buddhism  in  Scotland.  For  instance,  the  Indonesian  concept  of \u0100di Buddha would very much violate the limits of  a 'Buddhism' as it is propagated by the  FWBO, which stresses Buddhism's lack of  the concept of  a (creator) god to dissociate itself  from what it holds as the ideological focal point of  'Western culture', Christianity.10 Kristensen (1960:14): \"For the historian only one evaluation is possible: 'the believers were completely right.'\"11 Cf. 3.3.2: the coining of  the term 'Eastern Buddhism' by Japanese delegates to the World's Parliament of  Religions.- 78 -4.2 'Buddhism' and the European history of  religions 4.2.1 The Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte paradigmThe concept of  Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte (European history of  religions) is a relatively recent paradigm which can be outlined by at least two major characteristics: (1) It does not refer to additive histories of  religions in Europe, i.e. the sum of  all  positive religions in a regio-political space called Europe (Gladigow 2006:\u00a71).(2) In contrast, it aims to provide a historiography of  the \"full spectrum of  religious orientation\"12 (Gladigow  1995:24),  i.e.  \"the  European  'market  of   meaning supply'\"13 (Gladigow 1995:22),  which has also been exported, for instance, to North America (Auffarth 2006[1999]:650).According to Burkhard Gladigow (2002:61),  the Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte approach operates \"not (exclusively) idealistically, singularisingly, reductionisticly\" but \"raises the complexity  of  religious  phenomena  itself  as  [its]  subject\".14 As  a  result, Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte is concerned with \"the religions of  the various European traditions, as well as the religions of  migrants, as well as religions as epiphenomena of  academia, and religions which are passed on only within the medium of  scholarship.\"15 (Gladigow 2002:62-63)For  Gladigow  (2006:\u00a71),  this includes  'underground  currents'  (\"'Unterstr\u00f6mungen'\"), suppressed  patterns  (\"verdr\u00e4ngte  Muster\")  as  well  as  'heresies'  (\"'H\u00e4resien'\")  and (ideological) 'alternatives' (\"'Alternativen'\"). In addition, as Kocku von Stuckrad (2005:86-87) notes, Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte pays attention to constructions of  'the other', even if  not always institutionalised in Europe, such as 'the Islam' or 'Zoroastrism', against  which 'own' religious identities have been constructed for a long time. Thus, Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte abandons the world religions paradigm, which it regards as a product of 19th century missiology (cf. Gladigow 2002:62, 65).The  concept  of Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte became necessary  because  prior historiographies of  religious discourses in Europe had been formulated only in terms of 12 \"Gesamtspektrum an religi\u00f6sen Orientierungen\"13 \"der europ\u00e4ische 'Markt an Sinnangeboten'\"14 \"[Es] ist eine andere Religionsgeschichte, die nicht (nur) ideengeschichtlich, singularisierend, reduktionistisch operiert, sondern die Komplexit\u00e4t religi\u00f6ser Ph\u00e4nomene selbst zum Gegenstande erhebt [...].\"15 \"[...] Religionen der verschiedenen europ\u00e4ischen Traditionen, als auch Religionen der Migranten, als auch Religionen als Epiph\u00e4nomen von Wissenschaften, und Religionen, die nur im Medium von Wissenschaft tradiert werden.\"- 79 -Christian  church  histories  or  had  defined  Christianity  as  Europe's  own religion  (cf.  Gladigow 1995:24). Non-Christian groups, for instance, currents  commonly subsumed under  the  categories  of  'Esotericism',  'New Age'  or  'UFO religions',  as  well  as  the sciences as suppliers of  meaning had been omitted. What is more, the dominance of  Christian church history and the heritage of  missiology (Missionswissenschaft) had assigned Religionwissenschaft solely to the non-European context, whereas Christian theology had been in charge of  Europe (Gladigow 2002:50). According  to  Gladigow,  the professionalisation  (Professionalisierung) of  Christian religion within the milieu of  the Roman Empire had established its own definition of  religion  based  on  'singularisation'  ('Singularisierung')  (Gladigow  2006:\u00a720).  This 'singularisation'  raised  questions  about  true  and  false  religion  on  a  juridical  level (Gladigow 2002:57); it created  'polytheisms', a polemic term for all non-monotheistic systems,  which existed in the religion discourse solely as suppressions (cf.  Gladigow 2002:57); and it produced the exclusivist idea that one person can have only one religion (Gladigow 2006:\u00a720-21)Since  the Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte paradigm operates  on a 'broad'  definition of religion,16 it attempts to free itself  from this 'singularisation' discourse on religion, which has been introduced by one powerful religious group dominating the discourse from their  institutionalised  chairs  of  knowledge.  Instead,  it  aims  to  establish  a  scholarly framework  for Religionswissenschaft, paying  particular  attention  to  the  plurality  and coexistence of  religious discourses, meaning suppliers and religious innovations, which steadily emerge, live and die out.4.2.2 'Buddhism' as an element of Europ\u00e4ische ReligionsgeschichteIn my introduction, I have argued that 'Buddhism' can only be understood within a relational framework. Here, I would like to suggest that this relational framework may be  best  imagined  as  the Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte, with  all  its  models  of institutionalisation, dichotomies and other thinking patterns.Of  course,  the  major  challenge  on  a  theoretical  level  lies  in  integrating  the phenomena  we  currently  group  under  the  term  'Buddhism'  into  the Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte framework,  leaving  behind  missiological  world-religions  typologies. 16 It is broad when compared to a Christian theological definition of  religion.- 80 -Promising work has been presented by Philip Mellor, who produced the controversial  article Protestant Buddhism? The cultural translation of  Buddhism in England (1991).Mellor's concept builds on but must be distinguished from Kitsiri Malalgoda's (1976), Richard Gombrich's  and Gananath  Obeyesekere's  \"Protestant  Buddhism\" (1988),  or what Heinz Bechert (e.g. [1984]2002:341) called \"buddhistischer Modernismus\" ('Buddhist modernism').  The  \"Protestant  Buddhism\"  thesis  in  the  Asian  context  aims  at comprehending  the  phenomena  of  Buddhist  'revival',  which  introduced  formerly unknown  elements  such  as  lay  meditation,  socio-politically-active  bhikkhus,  the representation  of  Buddhism as  scientific/rational  and  the  introduction  of  English-language concepts into Asian languages (cf. Gombrich 1988:191-192, 194). It was called \"Protestant  Buddhism\"  because  Buddhists  copied  Protestant  Christian  missionary structures (Sunday schools,  book printing,  etc.)  and simultaneously protested against  colonial foreign rule and Christian missionaries (cf. LeVine/Gellner 2005:17-18).However, in his application of  the Protestant Buddhism thesis to England Mellor  does not only refer to lay meditation and Buddhist protest against Christianity. He also argues that Buddhism in England, and I consider this to be applicable to Europe as a whole,  is  not  necessarily  \"at  odds  with  western  religious  traditions\"  (1991:73);  in  addition, he rejects the concept of  a Buddhist essence moving from culture to culture (1991:88) and suggests that Buddhism has not been transplanted but rather  \"translated\" into an  already  existing  milieu  that  he  describes  as  (liberal)  \"Protestant  Christian discourse\" (1991:90): \"Buddhist groups in England are a 'significant new cultural development' not because they divert western culture into new religious channels, but because they explore the existing religious channels in new ways. Their significance rests in their ability to create new religious forms within liberal Protestant culture.\"(Mellor 1991:90)Mellor's findings, which were immediately attacked by the FWBO members Kulananda (1992) and Sangharakshita (1992a), have been widely discussed (e.g. Bluck 2006:161-162; Kay 2004:8-9, 136, 218-221; Waterhouse 1997:21-25; McAra 2007:19, 26-27, 32). Some scholars,  I  think correctly,  express  concerns about his  selection of  sources (Waterhouse  1997:24-25),  whereas  others  reproduce  untenable  FWBO  accusations towards Mellor (see McAra 2007:19, 32) or take positions which are questionable on historical grounds and almost Buddhist-apologetic (Kay 2004). David Kay, for instance,  claims to deliver a \"long-overdue critique of  the Protestant Buddhism thesis\" (2004:221, - 81 -10),  which he bases on the problematic notion of  \"deeply traditional\" continuities. 17 According  to  Kay,  those  phenomena  which  Mellor  and  others  scholars  (e.g.  Sharf  1995:250)  would  identify,  on  the  basis  of  historical  context  and  appearance,  as  Protestant  Buddhism/Buddhist  modernism are  actually  rooted in  \"deeply  traditional  precedents\"18 and  are  therefore  not \"Protestant\" but  (authentically) \"Buddhist\"  (Kay 2004:219).In addition, Stephen Prothero (1995:282, 296-299) points at a major weakness in the  Protestant Buddhism thesis in general; he argues that it has been constructed against a non-differentiated  image  of  Protestantism,  which  is  to  some  extent  also  true  for Mellor's  account.  Prothero,  therefore,  contributes  to  the  debate  his  term  'creole Buddhism',  emphasising  \"deep  structures\"19 (1995:281-182)  which  determine  the perception and organisation of  knowledge (cf. 2.2.4). I would like to suggest that the intersection between Prothero's \"deep structures\" and Mellor's \"existing religious channels\" can actually be understood as the dominant  'plot',  or  the  'grammar',  within  the Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte.  In  other  words,  the complex  interaction  between  religious  currents,  academia  as  a  curator  and  itself  a medium  of  (religious)  meanings,  various  ideological  patterns  and,  particularly importantly, the professionalisation of  Christian discourses, producing 'singularisation',  strongly affected and still  affect the fact that and the way how people communicate about Buddhism: (1) This created the discourse on Buddhism, constructing a box called 'Buddhism' with the size of  'religion' determining its content. (2) Recursively, 20 i.e. being its cause and effect at the same time, the box changed its size and, thus, selected new items for its content, depending now on its new size (cf. also Almond in 2.2.1).Moreover,  if  we  conceive  of Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte as a  narrative about the supply  of  meaning,  orientation,  (religious)  knowledge,  etc.  in  Europe,  the  relation between  'Buddhism',  as  the  story  about  Buddhism,  and Europ\u00e4ische  Religionsgeschichte becomes  clearer: Buddhism is  only  thinkable  within  this  narrative;  it  is  one  of  its  17 For a problematisation of  Kay see Prohl 2006:5-7.18 I.e., \"traditionally Buddhist forms and structures that have developed quite independently of  Western cultural contact\" (Kay 2004:221). Kay, however,  fails to provide a historical examination of  what constitutes these \"deeply traditional precedents\".19 I.e., Chomskyan 'deep structures'.20 In mathematics, a recursive function is a function which is defined through itself  (e.g. the factorial function: n! = n\u00b7 (n -1)!, for n>0). If  there is no terminating condition, any application of  the recursive function will result in an infinite loop. As for the time being, there does not appear to exist a noteworthy 'terminating condition'  for the recursive character of  the box of  Buddhism in particular and religion in general (cf. Beyer 2006).- 82 -protagonists, whose entering of  the scene I have been trying to trace in chapter 2 and which fulfils the particular role that is permitted by its surrounding discourse.For  instance,  as  a  result  of  'existing  religious  channels',  Buddhism  has  been constructed as a foreign, 'exotic' religion \u2013 since 'Christianity' has already been assigned to  'Europe's  own  religion'.  Indeed,  all  those  metaphors  of  transplantation  and acculturation are direct expressions of  the 'grammar' that administrates the products of what Jonathan Z. Smith calls \"an explosion of  data\" under colonialism (1998:275).By contrast, in Indonesia or Thailand (see 3.4.3) discourses of  nationalism created a selection pressure, resulting in nativistic constructions of  Buddhism. It is not that such  constructions  did  not  exist  in  Europe.  For  instance,  Donald  MacKenzie  (1928) attempted  to  anchor  Buddhism  within  Britain's  Celtic  history  (cf.  Ferm  1929; The Scotsman 1928:2);  furthermore, similar narratives about A\u015boka's Buddhist missionaries, resulting in constructions such as Graeco-Buddhism, can still be found in the repertoire  of  the  European  history  of  religions  (see,  e.g.,  Batchelor  1994,  Vassiliades  2004). However, in Scotland or the UK in general,  as noted in 4.1, the Buddhist groups in power have produced narratives along the limits of  the public discourse on Buddhism. The result may perhaps at present be described as 'Protestant Buddhism' and its impact on the 'western' perception of  Buddhism is summed up succinctly by Donald Lopez:\"When we  read  the  claims of  Hindu fundamentalists  that  locomotives  and  rocket travel are described in the Vedas or that the beam of  light emitted from \u015aiva's brow is really a laser, we smile indulgently. But when we read Buddhist descriptions (products of  the same time and the same culture that produced the Vedas and \u015aiva), descriptions, for  example,  of  a  universe  that  moves  through  periods  of  cosmic  evolution  and devolution,  we  assume  that  this  is  simply  something  that  physicists  have  not  yet discovered.\" (Lopez 1998:76)When adopting such a narratological approach to the Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte, we are brought  back  to  the  question  'What  does  a  particular  narrative  do?'.  Following this  question,  one  may  find  that  the  practice  of  speaking  about  religions,  classifying  religions, organising religions into 'theirs' and 'ours' (cf. J.Z.Smith 1998:276) has itself  become an aspect of  Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte . Indeed, the ongoing narrative about Buddhism, as well as its child Buddhism in the West, may have started in the 19th century, yet, it is still told today in schools, the media and universities. It continues to provide orientation and meaning when being told and, at the - 83 -same  time,  functions  as  a  preserving  medium  of  particular  (religious)  knowledge. Nevertheless, it has been extended; now, it includes narratives of  identity and helps to create chairs in a discipline called 'Buddhist Studies'. Reflecting upon this, I consider the  framework of  the Europ\u00e4ische Religionsgeschichte as broad enough to take into account of all these developments.What  is  more, such  a  perspective allows  for  a  plurality  of  histories  within  the historiography of  the \"full spectrum of  religious orientation\" (Gladigow 1995:24) since it enables us to traverse 'nodes' of naturalistic knowledge21 in various ways. For instance, we may apply von Stuckrad's matrix of  \"claims of  higher knowledge\" and \"ways of accessing higher knowledge\" (2005:88, 91) and arrive at a set of  what he calls \"esoteric  discourses\", which are not restricted to currents currently subsumed under 'Esotericsim'. As a result, we can overcome the use of  insider narratives as analytical tools (cf. Mellor 1991:88-89).  For  instance,  the  separation  between  'systems'  we  currently  classify  as 'Theosophy' versus 'Buddhism', as observed by Denise Cush (1996), is indeed hard to defend on historical grounds, for instance, for the 1920s. Of  course, the aim would not  be  to  replace  a  history  of  'Buddhism'  or  'Theosophy'  by  a  history  of  'Theobodhi'.  Rather, it would be to provide a framework where different academic, socio-historical or  socio-cultural narratives can exists as pares inter pares.The application of  such a dynamic framework provides one with the possibility to easily  construct  new  narratives  out  of  the  critical  analysis  of  our  older  narratives, without having to continuously de-construct the entire framework. For a metaphorical illustration of  these challenges and chances which lie within such an approach, I shall  conclude with Donald Lopez' critical reflections on his fieldwork at a Gelugpa exile monastery in Karnataka, where he had studied with a retired lama:\"Before departing from the teacher, it is traditional that the student not bow down, as he would at the end of  the day's teaching, signifying that the teaching has not ended, but is only interrupted. This suggests the possibility (or at least the dream) of  someday returning  to  the  monastery  to  read  once  again,  having  stopped  believing  in  the nostalgic meta-narratives, both theirs and ours, that have so far captivated us all.\" (Lopez 1995b:288) 21 I.e., non-metaphysical knowledge; e.g., the existence of  a source, the meeting of  a group, the writings of  a particular person, the invention of  a media device, the incident of  an earthquake, the introduction of  a particular law, the deaths of  hundreds of  people.- 84 -BibliographyAkong Tulku Rinpoche (1994[1987]).

      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine the compatibility of the philosophical and conceptual frameworks underpinning the person-centred approach and the Buddhist concept of mindfulness to clarify whether or not there is theoretical consistency for practitioners influenced by both approaches. The methodology used is a critique of the literature presented thematically, with arguments supported and extended by the authors own views and experience. It was concluded that, with the exception of relationship as a medium for change, there is a high degree of theoretical compatibility between the two approaches",
