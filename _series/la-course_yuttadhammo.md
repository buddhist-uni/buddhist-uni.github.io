A series of lectures delivered to yogis in Los Angeles in 2009.

I have reordered and renumbered [the original lectures]({{ page.source_url }}){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"} according to the chapters in [_Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path_]({% link _content/booklets/buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita.md %}) which they best correspond with, creating a more gradual and sensible order to the lecture series than you'll find online. It's therefore recommended that you listen to them in the order [provided on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6om_MKaiwvOHKUZMS-6pUEBAhAwtL06){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"} or below rather than chronologically.
