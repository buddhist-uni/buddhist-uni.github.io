A series of three short anthologies from the Saṃyutta Nikāya by different translators published as part of the larger [Wheel Series]({% link _series/wheel.md %}).

Taken as a whole, these three booklets form a substantial (about 150 page) anthology of the SN, but when compared, the three anthologies also make for an interesting contrast in translation styles.

The sutta index for the three volumes can also be found [as a PDF on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E0-9cTAeDZ5ZjEUzQW1uAMkRanwz_0Im/view?usp=drivesdk).
