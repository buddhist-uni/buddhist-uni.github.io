In order to answer the questions that Buddhist followers had about Buddhism, daily life and spiritual practice, Dharma Drum Mountain recorded the TV program "Great Dharma Drum" and broadcast it on Taiwan's television channel "Chinese Television Service" starting in 1994.

Ms. Chen Yue-ching was invited to serve as the host of the program.
