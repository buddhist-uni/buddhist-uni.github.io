A series of hundreds of substantial (40–80 page, 4.8x7.2-inch) booklets on a wide variety of topics published by [BPS](/publishers/bps), _The Wheel_ contained some of the best medium-length writing on Theravāda Buddhism in English from the 60s through the 90s. With the dramatically lowering cost of self-publishing, however, and the equally expanding market for trade books on Buddhism, their niche gradually closed and the last _Wheel_ was published in 2002, leaving behind a legacy of writing that has fortunately now been digitized and released for free distribution.
