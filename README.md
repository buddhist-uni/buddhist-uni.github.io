The Open Buddhist University is a [large](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/) library of free digital resources for those interested in Buddhism.

The courses, books, articles, talks, and more collected here are carefully curated to present a comprehensive, pan-sectarian introduction to Buddhist Studies and our shared, human world.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide:

- **University-Quality**
- **Pan-Sectarian**
- **Open-Access**

resources in English for those interested in Buddhism.

We curate a selection of academic material leveraging both what modern scholars and deeply-engaged practitioners have to say in order to present today's Buddhist traditions in a sympathetic but historically-accurate light.
Our collection is intended as a comprehensive curriculum for students and teachers of Buddhism, but researchers will no doubt find our resources helpful as well!

For more details on how our content is sourced, see our [Collection Policy](https://buddhistuniversity.net/COLLECTION_POLICY).

## Usage

The Open Buddhist University is and will always be completely free to use.
It can be accessed online at: [https://buddhistuniversity.net/](https://buddhistuniversity.net/)
