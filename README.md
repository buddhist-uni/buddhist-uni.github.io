# Introduction

This GitHub Page is my personal library of Buddhist media.

As a resource, a library has two audiences (and thus two priorities): 

1. First, a library is there to organize one's media for their safe-keeping, retrieval and study. 
2. Second, a library is there for others (hello, friend!) to peruse and, at best, benefit from

These two practical aims find unity in the pride that any book-worm feels towards their library: 

**A library is a reflection of its creator**---who they are and what they'd like to be.

Given that I'm a Buddhist monk, naturally my personal library represents a course of study in Buddhism.

In translating this proud, ancient tradition to the digital age, different constraints and possibilities emerged. Reflecting on the structure of the internet, I opted to express myself in a giant [mind map](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z8nvMf3Cbup6WA418). 

As a map of my mind, this library contains (editorially and structurally) my own biases. This is a feature not a bug. I named my camels with a great deal of thought, care, and delight and I hope that, as you explore my library, you will feel some of that delight too. üòä üê™

# Using the Site

There are two primary ways to study here: taking [the courses](https://buddhist-uni.github.io/courses/) or hanging out at [the library](https://buddhist-uni.github.io/library/).

The library contains all the best content I've found on the internet, [organized primarily by topic](https://buddhist-uni.github.io/tags/).

The courses provide contextualized and sequential walk-throughs of the same content, organized into progressive undergraduate-style syllabi. These lesson plans may be studied as-is or reworked for use by your study group or class. There are already teachers around the world using these syllabi as a starting point for their courses, and I couldn't be prouder!

# Structure of the Source Code

You can think of each of the `_folders` in the main folder as individual database tables. Each represents a different kind of object in the (hardcoded) "database."

- [_authors](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_authors) - Each author with their own page.
- [_content](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_content) - All of the individual works in the library, divided by `category` based on the type. Each content item has a number of [metadata fields](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) listing its bibliographic information (e.g. `pages`) in Bibtex format, or linking the entry out to its file (e.g. `external_url`) or linking it to its internal groups (e.g. `authors`). Conventionally, I put raw strings in `"Quotes"` and I represent links to other objects as `unquoted-slugs`. The templates then use these slugs to fetch the related objects at page render time.
- [content](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/content) - This (un-underscored) folder merely houses `index.html` pages for `/content/*` and doesn't represent any actual content.
- [_courses](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_courses) - The University's courses.
- [_data](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_data) - Site configuration [variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).
- [_drafts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_drafts) - Unpublished courses or blog posts.
- [_includes](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_includes) - A Jekyll folder which houses the site's [reusable UI components](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/).
- [_journals](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_journals) - Periodicals which get their own page.
- [_layouts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_layouts) houses the [html page templates](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/).
- [_posts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_posts) are the [blog posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) which make up the newsletter.
- [_publishers](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_publishers) are the publishers which I have granted their own hub.
- [_sass](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_sass) contains [the site's css](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
- [_series](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_series) - Are collections of `_content` items that were published as part of a `number`ed `series` (specified by fields on the content item)
- [_tags](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_tags) - The bibliographic topics, arranged in a directed, ontological graph via the `parents` field.

For more information, see [the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
