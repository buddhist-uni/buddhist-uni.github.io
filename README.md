The Open Buddhist University is a [large](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/) library of free digital resources for those interested in Buddhism.

The courses, books, articles, talks, and more collected here are carefully curated to present a comprehensive, pan-sectarian introduction to Buddhist Studies and our shared, human world.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide:

- **University-Quality**
- **Pan-Sectarian**
- **Open-Access**
- **Undergraduate-Level**

resources in English for those interested in Buddhism.

We curate a selection of academic material leveraging what modern scholarship says about pre-sectarian Buddhism to present today's Buddhist traditions in a sympathetic but historical light.
Our collection is intended as a comprehensive curriculum for students and teachers of Buddhism, though researchers may find some of our references helpful as well!

For more details on how we source our content, see [the Collection Policy Framework](https://buddhistuniversity.net/COLLECTION_POLICY).
