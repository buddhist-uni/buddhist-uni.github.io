The Open Buddhist University is an unaccredited, digital resource run by Khemarato Bhikkhu since 2020.
Its mission is to provide a free, English-language curriculum in Buddhist Studies from the perspective of Early Buddhism.[^ebts]

The website is based on
[Khemarato Bhikkhu's personal library on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}
which he [shared publicly](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/bgl-a-buddhist-g-library/13095?u=khemarato.bhikkhu){:target="_blank" ._} after his ordination in Thailand in 2019.
He hopes that you'll find these resources helpful and welcomes any feedback or questions at the email at the bottom of the page.

You can find [a video introduction to this website on YouTube](https://youtu.be/TPmTxHuQ9AI?t=22s), and can connect with other students of Early Buddhism over at the [SuttaCentral: Discuss and Discover](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/?u=khemarato.bhikkhu){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"} forum.

Thanks to [our contributors](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/graphs/contributors) for your help building the site.
