The Open Buddhist University is an unaccredited, digital resource run by Khemarato Bhikkhu since 2020.
Its mission is to provide a free, English-language curriculum in Buddhist Studies from the perspective of Early Buddhism[^ebts] to everyone.
We hope that you'll find these resources helpful and we welcome your feedback and questions at the email below (at the bottom of every page).

See [our sources page](/sources/) for a list of the sources we used to put together the collections.

You can find [a video introduction to the website on YouTube here](https://youtu.be/TPmTxHuQ9AI?t=22s), and can connect with other students of Early Buddhism over at the [SuttaCentral: Discuss and Discover](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/?u=khemarato.bhikkhu){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"} forum.

Thanks to [our contributors](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/graphs/contributors) for their help building the site.
