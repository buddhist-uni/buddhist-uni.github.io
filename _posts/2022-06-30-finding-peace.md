title: Finding Peace in the Turmoil
---

This month, we added two new sections to our library on [Samatha](/tags/samatha) and [Vipassanā](/tags/vipassana) Meditation.

Together, they represent the main focus of Buddhist meditation: on calm abiding and the development of wisdom.

In these stressful times, both are as important as ever.
To be able "to contend seriously with a problem, you first have to let it in," [as a recent podcast episode I loved](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/living-at-the-end-of-our-world) worded it.
And "letting in" is precisely the work of mindfulness.

But despite the urgency of change, we needn't shoulder everything alone.
Despite its quiescent reputation, Buddhist meditation is a _social_ emotional education system.

John Paul Martinez's poem "To Offer Sweet Fruit to the Ghost" was featured in [this beautiful episode of *The Slowdown* late last year](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/to-offer-sweet-fruit-to-the-ghost).
It shows how Buddhist "superstitions" can be powerful forms of connection and meaning making in difficult times—even if they are hard for us Western-educated children to accept:

> Ma says not to swat at the housefly  
chirring in our headspace  
for the past two hours  
because it just might be you.  
...

Read or listen to the rest of his poem at [slowdownshow.org](https://www.slowdownshow.org/episode/2021/09/29/512-to-offer-sweet-fruit-to-the-ghost)
and find hundreds of other poems, podcasts, papers, and a pot-pourri of other precious pieces on our website: BuddhistUniversity.net

As always, if you have any comments, questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to email me.
