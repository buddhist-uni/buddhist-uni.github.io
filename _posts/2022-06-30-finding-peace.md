title: Finding Peace in the Turmoil
---

This month, we added two new sections to our library on [Samatha](/tags/samatha) and [Vipassanā](/tags/vipassana) Meditation.

Together, they represent the main focus of Buddhist meditation: on calm abiding and the development of wisdom.

While separated here, they obviously support each other, because
"to contend seriously with a problem, you first have to let it in," [as a brilliant podcast episode on climate change](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/living-at-the-end-of-our-world) recently worded it.
In times like these, mindfulness is more important than ever.

But despite the urgency of change (in ourselves and in our world), we need not shoulder everything alone.
Despite its quiescent reputation, Buddhist meditation is a _social_-emotional education system.

John Paul Martinez's poem "To Offer Sweet Fruit to the Ghost" was featured in [a beautiful episode of *The Slowdown*](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/to-offer-sweet-fruit-to-the-ghost).
In his poem, Martinez shows how Buddhist "superstitions" can be a powerful form of connection and meaning-making in difficult times—even when they are hard for the Western-educated among us to accept:

> Ma says not to swat at the housefly  
chirring in our headspace  
for the past two hours  
because it just might be you.  
...
