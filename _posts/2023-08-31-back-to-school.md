Introducing [subtopics to Buddhist Philosophy](/tags/philosophy#children) and [the Human World](/tags/world#children).

---

Dear fellow students,

With September fast upon us it is already "Back to School Season" and here at OBU we're celebrating the start of the school year with **five** (!) **new bibliographies** on Buddhist Philosophy and our shared, human world.

**Right View**

[**Right View**](/tags/view) is the perspective conducive to liberation which is the cornerstone of Buddhist Philosophy.
Nāgārjuna is largely considered Buddhism's greatest philosopher
so I'm excited to share with you [this accessible selection of verses from his main treatise](/content/excerpts/selected-verses-mulamadhymakakarika_garfield-jay) as an entry point to his profound wisdom.

**Right Thought**

[**Right Thought**](/tags/thought) is the quality of discernment which amplifies the good within us while wearing away the unwholesome.
[This talk by Ajahn Jayasaro](/content/articles/skilful-desires_jayasaro) is an excellent introduction to the role of "skillful desires" in ["getting somewhere"](/content/articles/im-not-getting-anywhere-with-my_amaro) with our practice.

**The Human World**

In building out OBU's worldly collections, I've decided to divide up the immense subject into three basic categories:

- [**The Inner World**](/tags/inner)
- [**The Social World**](/tags/social)
- [**The Wider World**](/tags/wider)

This split was based largely on the Buddha's division of Karma into the spheres of the Mind, Speech, and Body, but my thinking here was also partly inspired by [Ken Wilber's "Integral" metatheory](https://integrallife.com/good-true-beautiful){:target="_blank"}.

It is my hope that these new offerings will help you hear [the sound of love](/content/av/love_krukowski) as you navigate [the world of men](/content/av/man-is-ishi_naddaff-hafrey).

Until we meet again: [besaydoo!](/content/av/besaydoo_kamara-yalie)
