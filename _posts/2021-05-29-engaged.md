title: Engaged Buddhism
---

This month, we've added a new bibliography on [Engaged Buddhism](/tags/engaged)!

It takes a sympathetic but critical look at the movement, starting with the methodological problem of [defining "Engaged Buddhism"](/content/articles/engaged-buddhism_temprano-victor) in the first place. The bibliography then highlights several examples of [Engaged Buddhists doing good works](/content/articles/building-resilience-preventing-burnout_pigni-alessandra) as well as [a few more problematic cases](/content/av/mindful-elite_kucinskas-jaime). In the end, it's up to you to decide whether Engaged or ["Disengaged" Buddhism](/content/articles/disengaged-buddhism_lele-amod) is right for you. I hope you will find the subject as throught-provoking and generative as I have!

I've also been busy this month making backend improvements to the site. You may notice that the content pages [load a little faster now](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/replacing-a-slow-include-with-a-custom-ruby-tag/6064), and that the "www." is now gone from the front of our URLs. I also identified and fixed a number of broken links around the website: If you ran into one of them before, please accept my apologies about that! Hopefully they will be less frequent in the future.

Lastly, I plan to spend the upcoming rains retreat almost entirely in seclusion away from the internet, so please anticipate that future updates will be less frequent. Thank you as ever for your kind support.

All the best until next time,
