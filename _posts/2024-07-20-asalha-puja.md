title: "Happy Āsāḷha Pūjā"
---

Today is Āsāḷha Pūjā, the last day before the annual rains retreat, and to celebrate the occasion I'm happy to announce what we've been working on the last few months:
the significant expansion of our _free_ library further into the history of Buddhism and the workings of the mind with the launch of **seven new bibliographies!** 

# Medieval Buddhism

**New Bibliography: [Medieval Buddhism](/tags/medieval)**

We can roughly divide the history of Buddhism into three periods: its [early growth in India](/tags/indian), its spread across Asia, and finally [its global spread West](/tags/west) in the modern era.
This new section of our library delves deeper into those middle ages where Buddhism spread across the Silk Roads and split into the many varieties we know today.

**Where to start**

The works listed there cover many critical topics, such as the entanglements and innovations in Buddhist Art and the role of medical knowledge in Buddhism's spread. But here I especially would like to highlight:

- [Buddhism and Society in the Medieval Estate System](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/buddhism-society-in-medieval-estate-system_toshio-kuroda)
   -  This work paints a vivid portrait of medieval life and explains how Buddhism fit into that social world. While the article is specifically about medieval Japan, I think its insights are broadly applicable across medieval Asia.

- [Re-Evaluating Zhu Fonian](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/t309_nattier-jan)
   - One of the biggest questions in the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism is how the apocryphal sūtras came to be written.  The forgeries are often extremely sophisticated and show a deep knowledge of (and even respect for) the Dharma.  So, what could compel a careful, erudite, Buddhist scholar to write a completely new sūtra?  
   Incredibly, we know the name and biography of one such scholar: Zhu Fonian. In this paper, Jan Nattier tells us his story.

# Theravāda's Roots

**New Bibliography: [The History of the Theravāda](/tags/theravada-roots)**

For those uninterested in the Mahāyana developments, this bibliography covers many episodes in the medieval history of "Southern Buddhism."

**Where to start**

The bibliography focuses largely on the Theravāda's Pāli texts and the sometimes surprising politics surrounding them.

- [Of Beggars and Buddhas: Politics and Humor in the Thai Jatakas](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/beggars-and-buddhas-politics-humor-in-vessantara-jataka-in-thailand_bowie-katherine-a)
  - In this interview, Katherine Bowie explains how _funny_ the Vessantara Jataka was to traditional Thai villagers, giving us a peak into the lively culture surrounding Theravāda's seemingly-austere literature.

# The Theravāda Canon

**New Bibliographies: [Rebirth Stories](/tags/rebirth-stories) and [Canonical Poetry](/tags/canonical-poetry) and [Abhidhamma Studies](/tags/abhidhamma)**

For those interested in just diving right into the Pāli texts themselves, we're pleased to now provide two bibliographies on the Khuddakanikāya and one on the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.

The Khuddakanikāya can roughly be divided into two parts: poetry collections and rebirth stories. The former are generally considered "early" and the latter "later" additions to the Canon, and thus the separation of the Kn into two different bibliographies.
You can look forward to more on the Kn later this year!

The Abhidhamma bibliography, by (surprisingly!) popular demand, has also been added, mixing together the canonical books with some of their exegetical works as well and rounding off our coverage of the Pāli Canon!

**Where to start**

Here I'd especially like to highlight a new project over at [ReadingFaithfully](https://readingfaithfully.org/) to create:
- [A Comprehensive Index of the Pāli Suttas](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/reference/cips)
    - As of this post, the project is in progress, but it is already a wonderful and large resource for exploring the Suttas by simile or by topic. I highly recommend it, both for casual reading and for serious study!

# The Media and Your Mind

**New Bibliographies: [Media Studies](/tags/media) and [The Intellect](/tags/intellect)**

In today's ever-connected world, media literacy is more important than ever.
I'm happy to announce today the launch of two new sections of our library on the general (secular) philosophy of mind as well as on how different mediums affect us.

**Where to start**

- [Climate Denial](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/climate-denial_hbomberguy)
  - A hilarious video about misinformation online, why it's produced, and why we fall for it.
- [Belief Traps](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/belief-traps-tackling-inertia-of-harmful_scheffer-marten-et-al)
  - In this paper, Scheffer et al explain the psychology of such "harmful beliefs" and what, according to science, actually works to get people out of them.
- [Attention Fracking](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/av/attention-fracking_burnett-d-g)
  - A stirring conversation about "The Algorithms" (YouTube, Facebook, Tik-Tok, etc) and how they are messing with our brains at an industrial scale.

# Stay Safe out there!

Opting out of the "attention economy" isn't easy.
For those who are going into seclusion for the next three months, I salute you! 🙏
And for everyone else, I hope that you're able to find some refuge and peace this *vassa* as well. 😊

And, just in case it _isn't_ peaceful and safe, [here are a few first-aid tips from the Red Cross worth reviewing](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/comprehensive-first-aid_red-cross) which I sincerely hope _don't_ come in handy for you!!

Wishing you the very best this Rains,
