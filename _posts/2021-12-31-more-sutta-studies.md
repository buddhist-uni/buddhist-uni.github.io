title: More Sutta Studies with Bhikkhu Bodhi
---

This month, we've added hundreds of lectures by [Bhikkhu Bodhi](/authors/bodhi) on the [Majjhima](/series/mn-study_bodhi) and [Aṅguttara](/courses/an) Nikāyas.

[The Majjhima Nikāya course](/courses/mn) on this site had previously contained only Bhikkhu Bodhi's lectures through 2010 which were hosted [at the Bodhi monastery website](https://bodhimonastery.org/an-extended-study-of-the-majjhima-nikaya.html){:target="_blank"}.
A "part 11" (from 2010--2015) covering the suttas not covered in the first 10 sections, however, exists [on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL23DE0292227250FA){:target="_blank"} and can now be found [on this website](/content/av/continuing-mn-study_bodhi) too.

And after thirteen years (!) of lecturing on the Majjhima Nikāya, Bhikkhu Bodhi decided to continue his sutta study classes by going through the Aṅguttara Nikāya: a series which is still on-going today.  You can follow that course [on YouTube here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgu0hJSLkqCWjjvc-lIKVn6CAUK95TbV4){:target="_blank"}.

Many thanks to [the eagle-eyed Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/qp8jix/the_open_buddhist_university/hjw904a/?context=3){:target="_blank"} who pointed these links out to me and to everyone else who gave feedback on the website recently.
The new, [bolder color scheme](/assets/imgs/apple-touch-icon.png) unveiled this month was also based on your suggestions, so thank you all again and please keep them coming!

As always, you can find me [over at SuttaCentral](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/?u=khemarato.bhikkhu)... where occasionally the content is as good as any you'll find in a prestigious journal:
