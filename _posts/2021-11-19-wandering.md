title: Wandering for the Benefit of Many
---

The end of the summer's rains retreat is traditionally when Buddhist monks would begin to tour the countryside, following the Buddha's instruction to "wander [...] out of compassion for the world" ([Kd 1:8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#pli-tv-kd1:11.1.0){:target="_blank"}).

As this rainy season ends, OBU sees a number of new pieces added to our existing collections, including some [films](/search/?q=%2Bis%3Afilm) and some [JPTS articles](/journals/jpts).
You can see the entire list of new content by subscribing to [the **new RSS Feeds**](/feed) which will notify you when any new content is added to the library.
For a primer on getting started with RSS, [see the Wiki on SuttaCentral](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/wiki-buddhist-rss-feeds-a-way-to-get-free-of-the-social-media-bubble/22253?u=khemarato.bhikkhu) and if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments there.

### Travel Logs
Of all the new content added over the last few months, I'd especially like to recommend the following, absolutely captivating, pieces which give windows into a few, remote, Buddhist cultures:
{% assign slugs = "school-among-glaciers,arhat-invitation-in-the-song_joo-ryan,stupa-sutra-sarira_barrett,tibets-first-khenmo-program_liang-taylor" | split: "," %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "slugs contains c.slug" %}
{% include content_list.html contents=content %}

### FAQs
I'd also like to highlight these beautiful answers to a few of the most commonly asked questions I see about Buddhist theory:
{% assign slugs = "symbolism-of-the-early-stupa_harvey,samadhi_analayo,buddha-nature-in-the-mahayana_liu-mingwood,enlightenment_yuttadhammo" | split: "," %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "slugs contains c.slug" %}
{% include content_list.html contents=content %}

I found the above extremely helpful and interesting and I hope that you will too!

As always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to email me and thanks for subscribing!
