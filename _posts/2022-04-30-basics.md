title: Returning to the Basics

This past four months, OBU has added no new courses or bibliographies to the site. The first third of 2022 has, however, seen:

1. a new [Buddhism 101 Course](/courses/buddhism) completely redesigned from the ground up featuring [lectures](/tags/buddhism#av) by 11 different teachers and 10 newly added [books](/tags/buddhism#monographs).
1. four new [external courses](/courses/#external-courses) added to our [course catalog](/courses/) on: the Tibetan Language, Human Biology, Shin Buddhism and Modern Poetry
1. and hundreds of new items added to [the library](/library), including some new favorites:
