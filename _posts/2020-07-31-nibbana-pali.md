title: "Two New Bibliographies"
---

This month I'm happy to announce two bibliographies on more advanced topics: [*nibbāna*]({% link _tags/nibbana.md %}) and [the Pāli Canon]({% link _tags/pali-canon.md %}).

I'm especially happy to finally share with you:

{% include inline_content.html category='essays' slug='purpose-of-meditation_mahasi' %}
- Mahasi Sayadaw's classic summary of the *Visuddhimagga* providing an excellent (if dense!) map of the path.

{% include inline_content.html category='monographs' slug='anguttara-anthology_nyanaponika-bodhi' %}
- Nyanaponika Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi's anthology of suttas from the Numerical Discourses is now available for free online.

{% assign cslugs = 'arahattamagga-arahattaphala_mahabua,dhammapada_buddharakkhita,dhp1_kmas,buddha-smiles_geoff' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

All classics, which I recommend most highly to any serious student---along with the rest of [the library]({% link library.md %}), of course, which remains open 7 days a week (regardless of Covid-19).

As always, feel free to email any questions or comments you may have.

Best wishes,  
Your friendly librarian  
Than Khemarato
