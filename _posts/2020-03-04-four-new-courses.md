I've been working on them for a long time and I'm happy to finally be able to share them. I'm especially proud of the<em> Form&nbsp;</em>and <em>Function</em> courses and recommend them both to novices and experts alike. I know I learned a lot while making them!<br>
<br>
As always, you can find the courses&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r">on Google Drive</a> or <a href="{% link courses.md %}">right here</a>.<br>

Happy Studying!<br>
