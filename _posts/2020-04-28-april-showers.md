title: "April Showers"
---

This month I've gotten a solid start on migrating over content from my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}. You'll now find **four** new [topic tags](/tags/) added to the [library](/library).

- [Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts](/tags/imagery)
- [Lay Buddhism](/tags/lay)
- [The Buddhist Path](/tags/path)
- [Buddhist Philosophy](/tags/philosophy)

Lots of new content has been added to fill those bibliographies, so check them out! In particular I'm excited to share with you:

- Ajahn Maha Bua's classic sermons, [A Life of Inner Quality](/content/booklets/life-of-inner-quality_mahabua)
- Dr Tucker telling us about [the evidence for reincarnation](/content/essays/interview-with-dr-tucker)
- And Curtis White asks us to [question our dogmatic belief in materialism](/content/articles/science-delusion_white-curtis).
- Rupert Gethin encouraging us to reassess how we read [the mythology of the Buddhist Canon](/content/articles/cosmology-and-meditation_gethin)
- Ajahn Brahm talking about the Buddha, supernatural powers, and his time in Thailand in [this fun sutta study class](/content/av/mn12-explanation_brahm)
- Ajahn Geoff writing about the unconditional [purity of heart](/content/essays/purity-of-heart_geoff)
- Ajahn Sujato defending both the bardo and comparative studies in [this compelling paper](/content/essays/rebirth-and-the-inbetween_sujato)
- Sir Edward Dyer [rejoicing in his virtue](https://www.bartleby.com/40/51.html){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}
- Lawrence Mills' translation of [Snp 4.2](/content/canon/snp4.2)
- [SN 1.71](/content/canon/sn1.71), which answers the question of when the Buddha would approve of murder!
- [This lovely sutta (SN 35.247)](/content/canon/sn35.247) which compares cognitive dissonance to six animals tied together: either with or without the "post" of mindfulness
- And, with calamity crushing in from all sides these days, [The Mountain Simile](/content/canon/sn3.25) feels more relevant than ever.

And last, but certainly not least, I am very excited to share with you [this profound interview with Professor Charles Hallisey](/content/av/studying-buddhist-scripture_hallisey-charles) which has been added to [Buddhism](/tags/buddhism) and [the Early Buddhist Texts](/tags/ebts).

I hope you enjoy this month's arrivals and, as always, feel free to email me with any thoughts or questions you might have.

Yours etc,  
The Librarian
