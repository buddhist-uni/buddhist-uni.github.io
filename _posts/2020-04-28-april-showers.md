This month I've gotten a solid start on migrating over content from my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ site.data.ga.drive_folder_value }}"}. You'll now find **four** new [topic tags]({% link tags.md %}) added to the [library]({% link library.md %}).

- [Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts]({% link _tags/imagery.md %})
- [Lay Buddhism]({% link _tags/lay.md %})
- [The Buddhist Path]({% link _tags/path.md %})
- [Buddhist Philosophy]({% link _tags/philosophy.md %})

Lots of new content has been added to fill those bibliographies, so check them out! In particular I'm excited to share with you:

- Ajahn Maha Bua's classic sermons, [A Life of Inner Quality]({% link _content/booklets/life-of-inner-quality_mahabua.md %})
- Dr Tucker telling us about [the evidence for reincarnation]({% link _content/essays/interview-with-dr-tucker.md %})
- And Curtis White asks us to [question our dogmatic belief in materialism]({% link _content/articles/science-delusion_white-curtis.md %}).
- Rupert Gethin encouraging us to reassess how we read [the mythology of the Buddhist Canon]({% link _content/articles/cosmology-and-meditation_gethin.md %})
- Ajahn Brahm talking about the Buddha, supernatural powers, and his time in Thailand in [this fun sutta study class]({% link _content/av/mn12-explanation_brahm.md %})
- Ajahn Geoff writing about the unconditional [purity of heart]({% link _content/essays/purity-of-heart_geoff.md %})
- Ajahn Sujato defending both the bardo and comparative studies in [this compelling paper]({% link _content/essays/rebirth-and-the-inbetween_sujato.md %})
- Sir Edward Dyer [rejoicing in his virtue](https://www.bartleby.com/40/51.html){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}
- Lawrence Mills' translation of [Snp 4.2]({% link _content/canon/snp4.2.md %})
- [SN 1.71]({% link _content/canon/sn1.71.md %}), which answers the question of when the Buddha would approve of murder!
- [This lovely sutta (SN 35.247)]({% link _content/canon/sn35.247.md %}) which compares cognitive dissonance to six animals tied together: either with or without the "post" of mindfulness
- And, with calamity crushing in from all sides these days, [The Mountain Simile]({% link _content/canon/sn3.25.md %}) feels more relevant than ever.

And last, but certainly not least, I am very excited to share with you [this profound interview with Professor Charles Hallisey]({% link _content/av/studying-buddhist-scripture_hallisey-charles.md %}) which has been added to [Buddhism]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}) and [the Early Buddhist Texts]({% link _tags/ebts.md %}).

I hope you enjoy this month's arrivals and, as always, feel free to email me with any thoughts or questions you might have.

Yours etc,
