title: "April Showers"
---

This month I've gotten a solid start on migrating over content from my [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RJi6bEXa25zizGdsm5evCycYuY6a2D8r). You'll now find **four** new [topic tags]({% link tags.md %}) added to the [library]({% link library.md %}).

- [Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts]({% link _tags/imagery.md %})
- [Lay Buddhism]({% link _tags/lay.md %})
- [The Buddhist Path]({% link _tags/path.md %})
- [Buddhist Philosophy]({% link _tags/philosophy.md %})

Lots of new content has been added to fill those bibliographies, so check them out! In particular I'm excited to share with you:

- Ajahn Maha Bua's classic sermons, [A Life of Inner Quality]({% link _content/booklets/life-of-inner-quality_mahabua.md %}){:target="_blank"}
- Dr Tucker telling us about [the evidence for reincarnation](https://wiswo.org/early-buddhism-2015/early-buddhism-20154/early-buddhism-20154-readings-1/){:target="_blank"}
- Rupert Gethin encouraging us to reassess how we read [the mythology of the Buddhist Canon]({% link _content/articles/cosmology-and-meditation_gethin.md %}){:target="_blank"}
- Ajahn Brahm talking about the Buddha, supernatural powers, and his time in Thailand in [this fun sutta study class]({% link _content/av/mn12-explanation_brahm.md %}){:target="_blank"}
- Ajahn Geoff writing about the unconditional [purity of heart](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/purityofheart.html){:target="_blank"}
- Ajahn Sujato defending both the bardo and comparative studies in [this compelling paper](https://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/RebirthandInbetweenState.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- Sir Edward Dyer [rejoicing in his virtue](https://www.bartleby.com/40/51.html){:target="_blank"}
- Lawrence Mills' translation of [Snp 4.2](https://suttacentral.net/snp4.2/en/mills){:target="_blank"}
- [SN 1.71](https://suttacentral.net/sn1.71/en/sujato){:target="_blank"}, which answers the question of when the Buddha would approve of murder!
- [This lovely sutta (SN 35.247)](https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247/en/sujato){:target="_blank"} which compares cognitive dissonance to six animals tied together: either with or without the "post" of mindfulness
- And, with calamity crushing in from all sides these days, [The Mountain Simile](https://suttacentral.net/sn3.25/en/sujato){:target="_blank"} feels more relevant than ever.

And last, but certainly not least, I am very excited to share with you [this profound interview with Professor Charles Hallisey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xQJhqAuu3uoj44qfTXW_ZaD-OCfrbWl/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank"} which has been added to [Buddhism]({% link _tags/buddhism.md %}){:target="_blank"} and [the Early Buddhist Texts]({% link _tags/ebts.md %}){:target="_blank"}.

I hope you enjoy this month's arrivals and, as always, feel free to email me with any thoughts or questions you might have.

Yours etc,  
The Librarian
