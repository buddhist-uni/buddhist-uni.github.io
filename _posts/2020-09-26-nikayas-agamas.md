title: "The Nikayas and Āgamas"
---

This month I've added information to the library on the four main [Nikayas]({% link _tags/sutta.md %})  (the [Digha]({% link _tags/dn.md %}), [Majjhima]({% link _tags/mn.md %}), [Saṃyutta]({% link _tags/sn.md %}), and [Aṅguttara]({% link _tags/an.md %})) along with their parallel [Āgamas]({% link _tags/agama.md %}) (the [Dīrgha]({% link _tags/da.md %}), [Madhyama]({% link _tags/ma.md %}), [Saṃyukta]({% link _tags/sa.md %}), and [Ekottarika]({% link _tags/ea.md %})).

In particular, I'd like to highlight [this free anthology of Bhikkhu Bodhi's Majjhima Nikāya translations]({% link _content/booklets/mn-selections_nyanamoli-bodhi.md %}) along with Bhikkhu Analayo's thorough [comparative analysis of the Majjhima Nikāya]({% link _content/monographs/mn-comparison_analayo.md %}) both of which are jewels of contemporary scholarship.

I'd also like to highlight a few beautiful poems which I've added to the library this month:

{% assign cslugs = "someday-ill-love-ocean-vuong,you-can-have-it_levine-philip,what-work-is_levine-philip,ud1.10_sdoe" | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

I hope you enjoy them as much as I have and, as always, feel free to email me with any questions or comments you may have.

Best wishes,  
The Librarian  
Khemarato Bhikkhu
