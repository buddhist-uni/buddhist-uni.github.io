title: "The Nikāyas and Āgamas"
---

This month I've added information to the library on the four main [Nikāyas](/tags/sutta)  (the [Digha](/tags/dn), [Majjhima](/tags/mn), [Saṃyutta](/tags/sn), and [Aṅguttara](/tags/an)) along with their parallel [Āgamas](/tags/agama) (the [Dīrgha](/tags/da), [Madhyama](/tags/ma), [Saṃyukta](/tags/sa), and [Ekottarika](/tags/ea)).

In particular, I'd like to highlight [this free anthology of Bhikkhu Bodhi's Majjhima Nikāya translations](/content/booklets/mn-selections_nyanamoli-bodhi) along with Bhikkhu Analayo's thorough [comparative analysis of the Majjhima Nikāya](/content/monographs/mn-comparison_analayo) both of which are jewels of contemporary scholarship.

I'd also like to highlight a few beautiful poems which I've added to the library this month:

{% assign cslugs = "someday-ill-love-ocean_vuong,you-can-have-it_levine-philip,what-work-is_levine-philip,ud1.10_sdoe" | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

I hope you enjoy them as much as I have and, as always, feel free to email me with any questions or comments you may have.

Best wishes,  
The Librarian  
Khemarato Bhikkhu
