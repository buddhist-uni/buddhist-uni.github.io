title: Vinaya Studies and The Mind Stilled
---

This short month saw two major additions to The University: [an advanced course on NibbƒÅna](/courses/nibbana-mind-stilled) (following up on [our previous course](/courses/nibbana)) and [a new bibliography of Vinaya Studies](/tags/vinaya-studies) (following up on our previous bibliographies on [monasticism](/tags/monastic) and [the canon](/tags/vinaya-pitaka)).

Somewhat complicating "The Canon," [Anne Blackburn, for example, encourages us to think about its "practical" subset](/content/articles/looking-for-vinaya_blackburn-anne) and Ajahn Geoff highlights a few conflicts between The Canon and its commentaries in his [extensive, and highly recommended, guide to the Vinaya](/content/booklets/bmc_geoff). The bibliography here aims to help (primarily monastics) make use of the texts.

On the meditation side, in addition to the profound [lectures by Bhikkhu Analayo](/content/av/nibbana-lectures_analayo) in the aforementioned course, I am also very excited this month to share with you [this classic talk on impermanence by Ayya Khema](/content/av/impermanence_khema) which beautifully summarizes the path of Vipassana Meditation. A real gem, be sure to give it a listen and check out our library's [other great talks](/tags/meditation#av)!

As always, if you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to email them in! And until next time,

Best wishes,  
Khemarato Bhikkhu
