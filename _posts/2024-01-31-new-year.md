title: "An Empty New Year"
---

Kicking off the new year, I'm happy to announce the addition of four new sections to our library on [Cosmology (*Saṃsāra*)](/tags/cosmology), [Emptiness (*Śūnyatā*)](/tags/emptiness), [Epistemology (*Pramāṇa*)](/tags/epistemology), and [Communication Studies](/tags/communication).

The first three sections are subtopics exploring different facets of [Right View](/tags/view) and "Communication" further extends our library's coverage of practical, [secular topics](/tags/world).

I'm especially pleased to introduce you to three of my favorite works on the true meaning of Emptiness (*Śūnyatā*):

{% include content_blurb.html category="booklets" slug="gifts-he-left-behind_dun" %}
- One of my favorite Dhamma books ever (period!), the short anecdotes and teachings in this collection never fail to touch my heart every time I reread them (which is often!)

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="free-will-no-such-thing_brahm" %}
- One perennially vexing topic in philosophy is the problem of "Free Will." By instead believing in "Free Won't," Ajahn Brahm has cut through the noise and pointed out that real freedom lies in saying "no." A truly profound teaching applicable in daily life and all the way to the realization of *nibbāna*.

{% include content_blurb.html category="av" slug="types-of-meditation_yuttadhammo" %}
- Lastly, this talk by Bhante Yuttadhammo in particular has stuck with me for a long time as one that gave me clarity and confidence in what it is we're doing in our meditation to transform our minds and see "reality."

All the works [here](/tags) (but especially these three) have been impactful on my learning and practice, and I hope you will find them useful as well.

Wishing you all success in your own spiritual journey,
