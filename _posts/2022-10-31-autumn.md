title: Back to School

Autumn is in the air and many new leaves have fallen into our library this month, especially on [Buddhist Nuns](/tags/nuns) and [how the Dharma came West](/tags/west).

The new Nuns' page contains a number of works covering [unordained forms of renunciation](/content/articles/mae-chis-and-ordination_battaglia) as well as [highlighting the reformers](/content/av/fulfilling-buddhas-vision_chomchuen-w) who are ["fighting"](/content/articles/imperfect-alliance_langenberg) the [patriarchy](/content/av/why-do-men-rule_factually) to [reestablish full ordination for women](/content/essays/bhikkhuni-timeline_zlotnick-mccarthy).

The story of how the Dhamma came West is probably best exemplified by [*The Chithurst Story*](/content/booklets/chithurst-story_sharp-george), in which one man's sincere intention and faith led to the founding of England's first forest monastery.
The importance of individual efforts is also highlighted in [Bhante Dhammika's profile of Mary Foster](/content/essays/mary-foster_dhammika): an unsung supporter of Anagarika Dhammapala, who, for his part,
did much to advance the position of Buddhism by [appealing to American and British Protestant sensibilities](/content/articles/roots-of-the-modern-monk_harrington).

Thanks to early advocates like them, Buddhism is still seen as [an anodyne, positive influence](/content/av/still-neutral_criminal) in the West today, though that view often [whitewashes the contributions of Asians in the West](/content/articles/weve-been-here_hsu-funie).
In her poem, ["A Year Dot"](/content/av/year-dot_okpik), dg nanouk okpik addresses that gap by beautifully paying homage to one of her own Asian-American teachers.

And, yes, **all** of the above links are highly recommended! So go check them out!

I hope this summer/rains treated you kindly and I'm happy to welcome you back to OBU for the 2022/23 school year.

If you'd like to have a short sutta delivered to your inbox every day this term, sign up for the [Daily Sutta Readings](/content/reference/daily-sutta) from our friends over at [ReadingFaithfully](https://readingfaithfully.org/).
The theme for November will be "generosity," about which [Dogen instructs the cook](/content/excerpts/tenzo-kyokun_dogen):
