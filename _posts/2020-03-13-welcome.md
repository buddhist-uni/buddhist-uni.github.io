title: "Welcome to the University"

Today I'm happy to welcome you to The Buddhist University at GitHub. Congratulations on your admission!

As you may have noticed, there are two primary ways to study here: taking [our courses]({% link courses.md %}) or hanging out at [the library]({% link library.md %}).

The library contains all the best content I've found for learning about Buddhism. 
Every piece featured in [the bibliographies]({% link tags.md %}) has been vetted for both accuracy and relevance.

As I slowly review and add more content, I highlight the best finds [here]({% link blog.md %}) as well as in the [email newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/buddhist-uni), so be sure to subscribe for the best free content on {% include tag-link.html tag="buddhism" %} available online.

Here are a few of my favorite pieces you might want to check out if you haven't already:

{% assign cslugs = 'on-love_jayasaro,miracle-of-mindfulness_tnh,putting-cruelty-first_shklar-judith,dealing-with-difficult-people_brahm,drums-and-bells_qing-de,economy-of-gifts_geoff,sn22.86,early-buddhism-with-kalupahana_payne' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

Congratulations again on making it here. I hope you learn something truly worthwhile, and I invite you to email me (at the address below) with any questions or feedback you may have.

Yours etc,<br />The Librarian, Than Khemarato
