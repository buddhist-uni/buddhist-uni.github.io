Today I'm happy to welcome you to The Open Buddhist University at GitHub. Congratulations on your admission!

As you may have noticed, there are two primary ways to study here: taking [our courses](/courses) or hanging out at [the library](/library).

The library contains all the best content I've found for learning about Buddhism. 
Every piece featured in [the bibliographies](/tags/) has been vetted for both accuracy and relevance.

For a video tour of the website, [click here](https://youtu.be/TPmTxHuQ9AI?t=117s)!

As I slowly review and add more content, I highlight the best finds [here](/blog) as well as in the [email newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/buddhist-uni){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"}, so be sure to subscribe for the best free content [on Buddhism](/tags/buddhism) available online.

Here are a few of my favorite pieces you might want to check out first, if you haven't already:

{% assign cslugs = 'on-love_jayasaro,miracle-of-mindfulness_tnh,putting-cruelty-first_shklar-judith,dealing-with-difficult-people_brahm,drums-and-bells_qing-de,economy-of-gifts_geoff,sn.022.086,early-buddhism-with-kalupahana_payne' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

Congratulations again on making it here. I hope you learn something truly worthwhile, and I invite you to email me (at the address below) with any questions or feedback you may have.

Yours etc,<br />The Librarian, Than Khemarato
