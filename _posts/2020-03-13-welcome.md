Today I'm happy to welcome you to The Buddhist University at GitHub. Congratulations on your admission!

As you may have noticed, there are two primary ways to study here: taking [our courses]({% link courses.md %}) or hanging out at [the library]({% link library.md %}).

The library contains all the best content I've found for learning about Buddhism. 
Every piece featured in [the bibliographies]({% link tags.md %}) has been vetted for both accuracy and relevance.

As I slowly review and add more content, I highlight the best finds [here]({% link blog.md %}) as well as in the [email newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/buddhist-uni), so be sure to subscribe for the best free content on Buddhism available online.

Here are a few excellent pieces you might want to check out if you haven't already:

{% assign cslugs = 'on-love_jayasaro,miracle-of-mindfulness_tnh,putting-cruelty-first_shklar-judith,dealing-with-difficult-people_brahm,drums-and-bells_qing-de,economy-of-gifts_geoff,sn22.86,early-buddhism-with-kalupahana_payne' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

... and [much more]({% link content/index.md %})!  If you need help with anything, just email me.

Congratulations again on making it here, and I hope you learn something truly valuable.

Sincerly,<br />The Librarian, Than Khemarato
