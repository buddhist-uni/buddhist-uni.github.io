title: "The Recollection of Friendliness"
---

Today, we at OBU are proud to announce **six** new bibliographies for you on
Theravāda Buddhism and human society.

## Theravāda Buddhism's national forms

This month we've added four new bibliographies on:

- [**Buddhism in Thailand**](/tags/thai)
- [**Buddhism in Burma**](/tags/burmese)
- [**Buddhism in Sri Lanka**](/tags/sri-lankan)
- [**Buddhism in Cambodia**](/tags/cambodian)

On each page you'll find a mix of books, papers, and talks covering that country's
unique religious history and how it came to shape the doctrines and flavors that
Buddhism took in each.

For example, [this medieval, Pāli chant](content/canon/caturarakkha)
put the recollections of the Buddha, friendliness, unattractiveness, and death
at the center of monastic practice across the Theravāda world.
You might argue that those recollections were already present in [Theravāda's earliest texts](/courses/ebts)
and they certainly were.
But [we make history by walking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104946.We_Make_the_Road_by_Walking).
Each generation of Dhamma teachers must choose which Dhammas to emphasize and
[their own way of teaching](https://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/tree-forest.pdf).

## The Wide, Social World

And to help advance understanding of our multi-cultural world,
this month OBU is also proud to launch two, new, secular sections on:

- [**Human Geography**](/tags/places)
- and [**Human Society**](/tags/society)

With governments around the world failing in their
[responses to the global refugee crisis](/content/articles/global-refugee-crisis-regional_lischer-sarah-kenyon)
and people everywhere wondering
[how to respond to rising tyranny](/content/av/tyranny_snyder-tim),
and how to [act out their despair](/content/av/end-of-the-world_tal),
I think it's more important than ever for us Buddhists, Śrāvakas and Bodhisattvas,
[to embody the ideal of "Good Spiritual Friendship"](/content/essays/spiritual-friendship_hasapanno).

[Our Karma is not just incidentally interpersonal](/content/articles/interpersonal-karma-note_ritzinger-justin-r).
Ultimately, there is no escaping living in dependence on others: even at
[the South Pole](/content/av/south-pole-tour_horneman-joe),
let alone [Mars](https://defector.com/neither-elon-musk-nor-anybody-else-will-ever-colonize-mars).
So, let us instead decide to live together with friendliness and grace.

Wishing you all the best blessings until next time,

Chief Librarian at the Open Buddhist University
