title: "Meditation After the Rains"
---

This month we celebrate the end of this year's rains retreat with five (!) new bibliographies on [the Saá¹…gha](/tags/sangha), [the history of Buddhism](/tags/roots) and [three new subtopics under "Meditation"](/tags/meditation#children):

**Right Effort** [[link]](/tags/problems):

A collection of talks and suttas to help inspire you when you're facing difficulties and challenges in your practice, such as [this classic talk by Ajahn Chah](/content/av/our-real-home_chah) delivered to a man on his deathbed.

**Right Mindfulness** [[link]](/tags/sati):

A collection of suttas and writings on what *sati* really is and how "remembering" the dhamma leads to success in meditation, such as [this classic book on meditation by Ajahn Mahabua](/content/booklets/wisdom-develops-samadhi_mahabua).

and **Right Concentration** [[link]](/tags/samadhi):

A collection on what *samadhi* is and can be, including, for example, [this fascinating pair of essays](/content/booklets/absorption_bronkhorst-johannes) on what absorption may say about "normal" psychology.

And lastly, in case those aren't enough to inspire your practice, [here is a reminder of what is coming in the future](/content/articles/future-of-human-climate-niche_xu-chi-et-al)...

May we all work out our salvation with dilligence!
