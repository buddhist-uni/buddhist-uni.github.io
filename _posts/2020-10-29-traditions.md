title: "The Two Traditions of Buddhism"
---

This month [the library]({% link library.md %}) took its first tentative steps towards covering the different forms of Buddhism, with new bibliographies on [Theravada]({% link _tags/theravada.md %}) and [Mahayana]({% link _tags/mahayana.md %}) Buddhism.

From the South, I'd like to highlight:

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="modern-buddhist-masters_kornfield" %}
{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="mn26" %}
{% include content_box.html category="av" slug="saving-buddhism_turner-a" %}

From the Northern schools of Buddhism, this month saw the addition of these two Tibetan gems:

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="cultivate-concentration_mipham" %}

{% include content_box.html category="essays" slug="from-the-oral-tradition_nyarong-terton" %}

And lastly, I wanted to share with you this sutta, which both traditions will agree is worth reading again and again:

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="mn22" %}

As always, if you find any typos or problems with the site, have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me a line. I'd love to hear from you.

Happy reading!
