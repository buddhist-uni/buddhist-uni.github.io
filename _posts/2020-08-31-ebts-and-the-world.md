title: "The World and the Early Buddhist Texts"
---

Following on [the Pāli Canon readings](/tags/pali-canon) from [last month](/posts/2020-07-31-nibbana-pali), this month [the library](/library) added [tags](/tags) on [the Vinaya](/tags/vinaya-pitaka) and [Sutta Pitika](/tags/sutta)s as well as [the Chinese Agamas](/tags/agama). I'm especially happy to share this translation of the Canonical Vinaya:

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="analysis-of-the-bhikkhu-patimokkha_suddhaso" %}

As well as this anthology of stories about the Buddha's disciples:

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="great-disciples_hecker-nyanaponika" %}

But, in addition to the usual Buddhist stuff, this month also saw the addition of a new tag on [The (Human) World](/tags/world) featuring miscellaneous favorites of mine, such as:

{% assign cslugs = 'mother-earth-mother-board_stephenson-neal,four-futures_frase-peter,sn.035.082,heartwood-of-the-bodhi-tree_buddhadasa' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

As with all the tags, if there's any favorite of yours missing, I'd love to hear about them! Feel free to email  suggestions or accolades any time.

Until then, or next time,

Best wishes,    
Than Khemarato
