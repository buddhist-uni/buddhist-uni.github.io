title: "The World and the Early Buddhist Texts"
---

Following on [the PƒÅli Canon readings]({% link _tags/pali-canon.md %}) from [last month]({% link _posts/2020-07-31-nibbana-pali.md %}), this month [the library]({% link library.md %}) added [tags]({% link tags.md %}) on [the Vinaya]({% link _tags/vinaya-pitaka.md %}) and [Sutta Pitika]({% link _tags/sutta.md %})s as well as [the Chinese Agamas]({% link _tags/agama.md %}). I'm especially happy to share this translation of the Canonical Vinaya:

{% include content_box.html category="canon" slug="analysis-of-the-bhikkhu-patimokkha_suddhaso" %}

As well as this anthology of stories about the Buddha's disciples:

{% include content_box.html category="monographs" slug="great-disciples_hecker-nyanaponika" %}

But, in addition to the usual Buddhist stuff, this month also saw the addition of a new tag on [The (Human) World]({% link _tags/world.md %}) featuring miscellaneous favorites of mine, such as:

{% assign cslugs = 'mother-earth-mother-board_stephenson-neal,four-futures_frase-peter,sn.035.082,heartwood-of-the-bodhi-tree_buddhadasa' | split: ',' %}
{% assign content = site.content | where_exp: "c", "cslugs contains c.slug" %}
<div class="narrow">{% include content_list.html contents=content %}</div>

As with all the tags, if there's any favorite of yours missing, I'd love to hear about them! Feel free to email  suggestions or accolades any time.

Until then, or next time,

Best wishes,
