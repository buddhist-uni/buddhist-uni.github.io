title: The Types of Mahāyāna
---

This month, the University expanded our Mahāyāna offerings with new sections of the library dedicated to [Chan](/tags/chan) and [Vajrayāna](/tags/tantric) Buddhism.

While the Vajrayāna is famous for its "magic," there is also a long history of "spells" in East Asian Buddhism, as Ryan Overbey explains in ["The Meaning and Function of *Dhāraṇī* Language"](/content/articles/why-not-translate-spells_overbey-ryan).

But the real heart of the Mahāyāna tradition is that just as:

> Apart from water there is no ice;  
Apart from beings, [there is] no Buddha.  
How sad that people ignore the near  
And search for truth afar  

You can read the rest of [Hakuin’s Song of Zazen](/content/essays/hakuin-song-of-zazen) along with dozens of other pieces on the history, theory and practice of the Mahāyāna now online at the [{{ site.url | split: '://' | last }}](/).

阿彌陀佛!
