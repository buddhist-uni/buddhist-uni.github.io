> Whenever we perform an action with intention, such action deposits a "seed" in the mind, a seed with a potency to bring about effects in the future.

A brief but thorough explanation of kamma, its potential for creating one's future, and the various realms of rebirth that it can lead to. Bhikkhu Bodhi ends by reminding us that the trajectory of our lives is in our hands, and that the ultimate aim of Buddhism is to reach the freedom of liberation.
