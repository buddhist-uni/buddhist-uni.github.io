> When feelings of discouragement come up and we are tired and disheartened we
might want to give up our efforts, but once we have given up, there is no chance any
more to reap the benefits of the practice. So at least keep trying, everyone. Whether we
have already attained peaceful states or not doesn’t matter. Just keep on meditating,
sitting or walking. Peaceful or not.
