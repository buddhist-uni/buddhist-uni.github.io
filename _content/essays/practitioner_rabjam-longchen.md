> With your own mind under control, help others in any way you can,  
> And take whatever you experience onto the path to liberation.  

> Therefore, inspect your mind, make it ready now,
And consider this: Were you to die now, what would become of you?

Longchen Rabjam emphasizes that a true meditation practitioner must renounce worldly distractions, diligently stabilize the mind, uphold ethical conduct and devote themselves day and night to the profound path of liberation.
