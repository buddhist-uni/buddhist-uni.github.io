> Single embodiment of all the buddhas' compassion,
Lotus King, chief of all sky-faring ḍākas and ḍākinīs,
Miraculously born nirmāṇakāya, untainted by a womb —
To this great eternal bearer of the lotus, I bow down!

In this devotional poem, Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö praises Tso Pema (Lotus Lake), a sacred site in Rewalsar, India, associated with Guru Padmasambhava. The poem extols the miraculous transformation of a funeral pyre into a lotus-filled lake and praises Padmasambhava's enlightened qualities and compassionate activities
