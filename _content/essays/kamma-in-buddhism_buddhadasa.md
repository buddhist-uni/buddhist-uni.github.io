> We should see the
truth that the mind that performs a deed is kamma itself and the
subsequent mind is the result (vipāka) of that kamma. Other
results that follow it are only uncertain by-products, since they
may or may not occur, or do not keep up with our expectations
due to other interfering factors.

In this monograph, the author explains kamma (karma) as it is understood in Buddhism and how to use kamma (action) in a way that leads to the end of action and results in nibanna.
