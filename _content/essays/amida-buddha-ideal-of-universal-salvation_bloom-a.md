> As Reality, Amida is the buddha-nature in everything. This means that everything has the potential to support and realize spiritual life. All our relationships, even negative ones, can enhance or expand our religious vision and understanding.

This short essay by Dr. Alfred Bloom explores how Amida Buddha's vows form the foundation of the Pure Land tradition's vision of universal salvation. While emphasizing that these vows create the Pure Land as an ideal realm for awakening, Bloom also underscores that Amida, as dharmakaya, represents the buddha-nature inherent in all thingsâ€”making awakening possible anywhere.
