> Exert yourself in the Dharma, therefore, Lodrö,
Before you must bear the burden of your misdeeds.
Don’t squander this freedom while you have the chance,
O child, but apply your mind to the cultivation of virtue.

A short poem meant to remind the author of the importance of sustained practice and recognizing our shortcomings, especially in the face of impending death.
