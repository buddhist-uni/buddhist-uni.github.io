> we are dealing here not with two groups but with three: the Dhammayut order of the
Third and Fourth Reigns, which is the parent group; the Dhammayut order of
the Fifth Reign and later, which is the royal child; and the
Forest tradition, which is the parent groupâ€™s peasant child.

This essay explores the roots of the contemporary Thai Forest Tradition with an eye to explaining the dynamics that other historians have missed.
