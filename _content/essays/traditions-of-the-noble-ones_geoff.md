This essay explores the Thai Forest Tradition’s roots, practices, and dynamic relationship with the centralized Dhammayut hierarchy. It highlights the forest tradition’s emphasis on ascetic practices (dhutanga) and adherence to the Vinaya, contrasting with the more institutional focus of the Dhammayut order.
