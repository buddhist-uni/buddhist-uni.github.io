> Therefore, it is definitely possible to come to a direct, first-person knowledge and vision of the factual reality of my present experience as it arises in the present without having to elevate it to a form of conceit, māna. 

In this interview, Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā discusses her paper for the 2021 TLKY International Conference. That paper focused on the dialogue between early Buddhism and postmodern discourse on ideas of self-identity, self-conceit, and the construction of first-person experience. The interview also discusses other topics, such as subjectivity and liberation. See Dhammadinnā's published version of this paper here[(/content/papers/reflections-truth-experience-early-buddhist-epistemology_dhammadina)].
