> There are thus a great many systems of Dharma teaching in Tibet,

But aside from their nominal variations,

There is really no significant difference between them

All share the crucial point of seeking ultimate awakening.

In this concise work, Chökyi Lodrö offers a clear and accessible overview of the four major Tibetan Buddhist traditions—Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug—highlighting their unique lineages, practices, and shared objectives. He emphasizes the universal path to enlightenment through ethical discipline, meditation, and wisdom, providing practical guidance on cultivating virtues and accumulating merit to achieve lasting happiness.
