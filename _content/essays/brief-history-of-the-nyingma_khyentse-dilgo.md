> It is through the generosity of King Trisong Detsen, the monastic ordinations given by the abbot Shantarakshita, and the spiritual transmissions given by Guru Padmasambhava, that the Buddhist tradition was able to spread and flourish in Tibet from early times up to the present.

A brief introduction to the Nyingma (Ancient Translation) school of Tibetan Buddhism, founded on the tantric and terma traditions of Guru Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita in the 8th century, written by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who was head of the Nyingma school from 1988 to 1991, and one of its most revered modern masters.
