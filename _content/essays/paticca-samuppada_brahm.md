While dependent origination can be understood as describing both our moment-to-moment "rebirth" as well as rebirth from lifetime-to-lifetime, many modern scholars sceptical of rebirth have downplayed the latter interpretation. Ajahn Brahm defends the multiple-lifetime interpretation of _Paṭicca-samuppāda_ by citing the Buddha's own analysis of its twelve factors.
