> The heart is what is aware. When the current of sound dealing with
the Dhamma comes in and makes continual contact with the heart, the
heart won’t have any chance to go slipping outside, because the Dhamma
is something calming and absorbing.

In this short discourse, Venerable Maha Boowa explains that the Dharma is found in the stilled and purified heart, and this is something to be experienced rather than simply believed.
