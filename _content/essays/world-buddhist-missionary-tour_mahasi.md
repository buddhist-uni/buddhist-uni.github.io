> I urge you to meditate beforehand, i.e., before you come across old age, sickness and death

Six brief talks given by Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw in 1952 around Asia on the path to Nibbana while on a tour sponsored by the newly-independent
Burmese government to drum up support for its then-upcoming [Sixth Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Buddhist_council).
