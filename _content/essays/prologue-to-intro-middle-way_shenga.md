> This work however introduces the ten transcendent perfections and eleven bhūmis on the basis of relative truth and, on the basis of the ultimate truth, explains how there is no arising even conventionally according to the four extremes. Thus, this commentary on the intent of the Middle Way includes several uncommon features not found in the works of other scholars.

Khenpo Shenga's prologue to Madhyamakāvatāra emphasizes that Candrakīrti's text serves as a comprehensive introduction to Nāgārjuna's Mūlamadhyamaka-kārikā, elucidating the two truths—relative and ultimate—and their interdependence.
