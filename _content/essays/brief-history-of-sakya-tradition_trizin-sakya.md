> The Sakya Tradition has the
distinction of having a close connection with the other three
major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The Vajrakila lineage, which
the Sakyapas follow, originates from Guru Padmasambhava, the
founding master of the Nyingma school. The Kagyu and the
Sakya schools originated almost at the same time, and both
received important lineages from Naropa.

This brief essay outlines the origins and development of the Sakya Tradition, which began in the eleventh century and has been closely associated with Tibetâ€™s Khon family.
