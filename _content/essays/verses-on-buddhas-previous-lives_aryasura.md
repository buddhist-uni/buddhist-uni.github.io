> May I too accomplish the transcendent perfection  
Of ethical discipline, just like you!

This prayer for accomplishing the transcendent perfections, attributed to Āryaśūra, is adapted from Dharmakirit's commentary on the Jātakamālā. Covering the first four perfections, additional verses for the remaining perfections and birth stories were composed by the Third Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje.
