> The precariousness of intimate speech adds to its power and the power of the reader, through whose agency the voice is encouraged in its urgent plea or confidence.

Poet Louise Glück graciously accepts the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature in a master class of rhetoric and humility.

You can also watch Glück rereading her speech for [the Nobel YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/0aE0lSWnvC8) just months before she passed away from cancer in October of 2023.
