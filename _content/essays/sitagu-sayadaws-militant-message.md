After Sitagu Sayadaw, a revered Myanmar Buddhist leader, delivered a speech supporting the military and minimizing the sinfulness of killing, he was criticized for promoting a genocidal message against non-Buddhists. This controversial stance sparked backlash from fellow Buddhists, who condemned the monk's alignment with the military and his departure from Buddhist teachings of compassion and non-violence.
