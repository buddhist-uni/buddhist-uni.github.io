> To practise
Dhamma means to apply the Dhamma, to use the Dhamma
in conducting your life and work.

This work is a translation of “Thamma chabap rian lat”, designed to help newcomers to Buddhism understand key principles and their practical applications. It is also valuable for those already practicing the Dharma, furthering their understanding. The book is divided into four sections, each with a focus on different aspects of practice.
