> Language is dealt with in Tibetan epistemological treatises in terms of the relationship between “what expresses” (rjod byed) and “what is expressed” (brjod bya)—two notions that come quite close to the Saussurian distinction between “signifier” and “signified.”

The Tibetan tradition of epistemology and philosophy of language focuses on how knowledge is defined, validated, and expressed. This article explains the rich tradition and examines key concepts like "reliable cognition" and the influence of Indian Buddhist thinkers such as Dignāga and Dharmakīrti on Tibetan thought.
