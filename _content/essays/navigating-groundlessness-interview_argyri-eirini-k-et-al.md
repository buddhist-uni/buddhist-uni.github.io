> We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 people who reported experiencing existential distress following psychedelic experiences.
> We explored the phenomenology of participants' difficulties and the ways they navigated them, including what they found helpful and unhelpful in their process.

> Our findings suggest that psychedelic-induced ontological shock leads to cognitive, emotional and social ungrounding which can in turn lead to existential confusion.
> Grounding, whether somatic, through embodiment practices, or through social connection and the normalisation of unusual experiences, helped people navigate their confusion
