> Leave behind the analogies of foolish minds and modes of speech,
And look instead into the mind for which there can be no analogy.

In this poetical advice, Mipham Rinpoche calls on his listeners to forget conceptions of reality, no matter how grand, and to look directly at the mind in order to gain wisdom.
