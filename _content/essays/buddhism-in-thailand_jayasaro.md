In this short talk, Ajahn Jayasaro discusses the history of Theravada Buddhism in Thailand. He then explores the significance of the forest tradition and the reforms initiated by King Mongkut to centralize the monastic order, as well as the role of monks like Ajahn Mun and Ajahn Chah in shaping modern Thai Buddhism. He concludes by highlighting the challenges Thai Buddhism faces in current times.
