> Most fundamentally, we have realized that there is no single unitary Bud-
dhist viewpoint on the relationship between healing and salvation. The vinayas, āgamas, and sūtras being translated in medieval China were the
products of a wide range of time and geography, and reflected different,
even mutually incompatible, priorities.

This article shows how the boundaries between healing and awakening are constructed and defended in Buddhist discourses. Rather than looking at Buddhist literature through the usual lenses of authorship and translation, Salguero focuses on the language, categories, and logics internal to the Buddhist texts themselves.
