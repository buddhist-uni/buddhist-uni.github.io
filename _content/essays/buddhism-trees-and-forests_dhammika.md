> The thing that first comes to mind is the Buddha’s immediate connection with trees, the fact that he was born under a tree, had an early spiritual experience under a Eugenia jambolala tree, became
Awakened under a Ficus religiosa, and passed away between two Shorea robusta. But it would be a mistake to think that this was the most significant connection between the Buddha or Buddhism and trees.

This article briefly discusses the importance of trees outside of the usual incidents tied to the Buddha Shakyamuni's life.
