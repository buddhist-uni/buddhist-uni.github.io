> Now, for as long as I live, bless me so that
I shall not deceive myself with so many pointless acts,
But end my days striving in the practice of profound Dharma.

In this short lamentation, Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö invokes the blessings of his guru, Jamyang Loter Wangpo, to live an honest life of Dharma practise, despite his shortcomings.
