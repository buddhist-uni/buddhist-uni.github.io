> These days, however, if you consult followers of Mahāmudrā, Dzogchen and the like, they will not make even the slightest acknowledgement of instructions that suit people's actual capacity, such as the way to progress in tranquillity and insight taught in the scriptural approach of the great pioneers. 

In this work, Dongak Chökyi Gyatso emphasizes that advanced teachings like Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen are most effective when tailored to an individual's capacity, distinguishing between general instructions and those suited for exceptional practitioners. He critiques the indiscriminate application of these profound methods, advocating for a gradual approach rooted in scriptural tradition to ensure proper understanding and avoid potential misapplication.
