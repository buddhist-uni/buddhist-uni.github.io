> One of the ironies of the
bhikkhuni controversy in
Sri Lanka is that both sides
seem to believe that the
very integrity of Theravada
Buddhism is at stake in the
bhikkhuni revival.

This article explores the revival of the Sri Lankan bhikkhuni (Buddhist nun) order, which had been extinct for nearly a millennium until its reinstatement in the late 1990s through international ordination ceremonies. Despite controversy over its legitimacy, the bhikkhuni order has grown with increasing support from laypeople and some monks, though challenges remain, such as the lack of formal government recognition and financial aid. Bhikkhunis are praised for their discipline, ethical conduct, and contributions to Buddhist communities, yet tensions persist between them and dasasil nuns, who follow an alternative path without full ordination.
