> This is a song of impermanence, a meditation,
“A Great Light for the Middle Way’s Illumination”,
It’s purpose is to strengthen the mind’s determination
For Dharma
From the start, in the middle, to Ultimate Liberation.

Könchok Tenpe Drönme's response to his disciple, Zhabdrung Ngawang Drakpa, who requested advice in verse on how to meditate on impermanence.
