> Although buddhas and bodhisattvas came in the past,  
Their activities pervading throughout the three realms,  
Now they are no more, and only their names remain,  
Still, in this they are teachers of impermanence.

Könchok Tenpe Drönme's response to his disciple, Zhabdrung Ngawang Drakpa, who requested advice in verse on how to meditate on impermanence.
