> The Taliban were by no means the first people to try to destroy the Buddhas, Islamic iconoclasts had
been hacking away at them for centuries. The Emperor Aurangzeb ordered cannons to blast the statues, as
did a Persian king in the 18th century. Both attempts damaged but did not destroy the statues.

This essay is a brief history of and reflection on the Buddhas of Bamiya.
