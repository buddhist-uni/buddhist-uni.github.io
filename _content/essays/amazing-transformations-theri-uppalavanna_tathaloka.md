> this is the unique and crowning aspect of Uppalavaṇṇā’s
story in this image. For, having been the greatest (perhaps male) worldly ruler, her final and
enlightened form is of a female ascetic by choice, illustrating not only a transcendence of the
relative and going beyond, but a congruent – and perhaps thus far more radical – manifestation of
the mundane and supermundane, the essential and conventional.

This article delves into the story of Bhikkhuni Uppalavanna, a female disciple of the Buddha, and the growth and complexities her story took over the centuries in different Buddhist traditions and texts. Of particular note is the article's presentation of various artistic works focusing on Uppalavanna.
