> Although this is a matter of preparing and serving meals, the *tenzo* is not just "the cook."

A beautiful and classic (13th century) essay on the Zen of running the monastery kitchen.

An alternate translation by Griffith Foulk can be found on [The Zen Site](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Instructions_for_the_cook.html){:ga-event-value="0.5"}.
