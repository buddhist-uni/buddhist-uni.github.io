> Since fear discourages the aspirant and dissuades him from seeking seclusion, staying in the wild was a proven method for reducing and eventually eliminating this kilesa (defilement).

This is the third chapter of Tiyavanich's "Forest Recollections." Focusing on Thudong monks of the early 20th century, it discusses how living in the wilderness, with all of the varied animals and reptiles, was a valuable practice for training the mind by overcoming fear, which arises from a deep sense of self.
