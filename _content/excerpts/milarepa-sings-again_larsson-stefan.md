> mGur (pronounced gur) denotes a specific type of religious poetry that has played an important role in the expression and transmission of Buddhism across the Tibetan cultural world. The term mgur is usually translated as ‘song’ and it has been used to refer to a wide variety of oral and literary creations.

Tibetan Buddhism has historically included non-monastic practitioners who used religious poetry (mGur) to share their spiritual teachings. Through the life and works of Milarepa and Tsangnyön Heruka, this work explores how wandering yogins revitalized Buddhism by presenting it in accessible, creative ways beyond traditional institutions.
