As Buddhism came (comes) West, its followers have often been accused of following a "fad" or, worse, a cult. In this fascinating chapter, Ken Wilber provides a theoretical framework for distinguishing (or at least describing) the difference between "good" and "bad" forms of religious authority. 

Helpful for avoiding cults, for reassuring Westerners that Buddhist religious authority isn't regressive, and a fascinating example of the West grappling with unfamiliar forms of spiritual education.
