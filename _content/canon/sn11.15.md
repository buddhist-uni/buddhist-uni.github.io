> Shrines in parks and woodland shrines,  
Well-constructed lotus ponds:  
These are not worth a sixteenth part  
Of a delightful human being.  
>  
> Whether in a village or forest,  
In a valley or on the plain--  
Wherever the *arahants* dwell  
Is truly a delightful place.

Sakka asks what place is truly delightful and the Buddha replies.
