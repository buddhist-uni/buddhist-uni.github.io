> I say it's not possible to know, see or reach the end of the world by traveling. But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world.

The mendicants ask Ānanda to explain this enigmatic statement derived from [the famous story of Rohitassa](/content/canon/sn2.26).
