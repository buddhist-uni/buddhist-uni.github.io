The traditional, commentarial introduction to the Pāli Jātaka collection containing the most famous mythologized biography of the Buddha.

This translation by T. W. Rhys Davids also contains his own introduction to the Jātakas, which remains worthwhile even a century later. Many thanks to [Ānandajoti Bhikkhu]({% link _authors/anandajoti.md %}) for making the book available in a polished, digital format.
