When Venerable Vakkali is ill, he asks the Buddha to visit him. The Buddha does so, but says there is no point in seeing his physical body, as [one who sees the Dhamma sees him](/content/canon/iti92).

In a dramatic continuation of the story, Ven. Vakkali is then taken to the Black Rock on Isigili, where he declares that he has no attachment to the aggregates and proceeds to take his own life.
