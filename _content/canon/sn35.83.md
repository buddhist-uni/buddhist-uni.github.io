> There is no eye, Phagguna, by means of which one describing the Buddhas of the past could describe them...

Worth keeping in mind that the suttas (like Iti 61) enumerate three kinds of eye: "The flesh eye, the divine eye, and the eye of wisdom."
The Buddha here says that not even the heavenly eye or the dhamma eye can describe the past Buddhas.
