> … for one who sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world.

Venerable Kaccānagotta asks the Buddha about right view.

This sutta, brief but profound, became renowned as the only canonical reference named in [Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā](/content/excerpts/selected-verses-mulamadhymakakarika_garfield-jay), perhaps the most famous philosophical treatise in all of later Buddhism.
