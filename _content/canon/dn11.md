The Buddha refuses to perform miracles for a layman, explaining that this is not the right way to inspire faith. He goes on to tell the story of a monk's misguided quest for spiritual answers, an answer the Buddha ultimately gives in one of the most profound poems of the Canon.

> Consciousness that’s invisible,  
infinite, radiant all round.  
Here’s where water and earth,  
fire and air find no footing;  
here’s where long and short,  
fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly;  
here’s where name and form  
cease with nothing left over--  
with the cessation of consciousness,  
that’s where this all ceases.
