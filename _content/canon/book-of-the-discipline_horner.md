The first English translation of the Vinaya Pitaka, [Bhikkhu Sujato](/authors/sujato) and [Bhikkhu Brahmali](/authors/brahmali) prepared this ebook version of the PTS volumes.

**Beware though!** This translation is known to have many mistakes! For a partial list, see [*Tiradhammo (JPTS v19)*](https://archive.org/download/jpts-xix-1993/Corrections%20to%20The%20Book%20of%20Discipline-%20Thiradhammo_text.pdf){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.35"}

Ajahn Brahmali's excellent, new translation is much preferred. It can be found [online at SuttaCentral.net](https://suttacentral.net/edition/pli-tv-vi/en/brahmali?lang=en){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="3"}
