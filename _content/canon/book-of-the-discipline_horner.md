The first English translation of the Vinaya Pitaka, [Bhikkhu Sujato]({% link _authors/sujato.md %}) and [Bhikkhu Brahmali]({% link _authors/brahmali.md %}) prepared this ebook version of the PTS volumes.

**Beware though!** This translation is known to have many mistakes! For a partial list, see [*Tiradhammo (JPTS 19)*](https://archive.org/download/jpts-xix-1993/Corrections%20to%20The%20Book%20of%20Discipline-%20Thiradhammo_text.pdf){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.35"}

Ajahn Brahmali's excellent, new translation is much preferred. It can be found [online at SuttaCentral.net](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="3"}
