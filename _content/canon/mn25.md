> a trapper doesn’t cast bait for deer thinking, ‘May the deer, enjoying this bait, be healthy and in good condition. May they live long and prosper!’ 🖖

A lovely illustration of the importance of samatha jhana for living the holy life sustainably, and a memorable simile on the ways that Mara can trap a mendicant.
