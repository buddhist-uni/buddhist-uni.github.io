> Formerly, Anurādha, and also now, I teach just suffering and the cessation of suffering.

Venerable Anurādha is questioned by a number of ascetics, and ends up by saying that the Realized One is described in terms other than “existing after death” and so on. The wanderers say he’s a fool, so he checks with the Buddha, who says that a Realized One is not even apprehended in this life, so how can he be described after death?

[Ven. Sunyo on D&D](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/i-declare-only-suffering-and-its-cessation-the-buddha-indeed/31825?u=khemarato.bhikkhu) makes a compelling argument that the Buddha's final statement here is meant categorically, not pedagogically.
