> I offered eight fallen flowers to the stupa...

[Gregory Schopen](https://doi.org/10.1515/9780824851224-008){:target="_blank"} (among others) has pondered the lack of stupa-related rules in [the Theravada Vinaya](/tags/vinaya-pitaka) and wondered if this might reflect a sectarian difference in stupa worship.
This *sutta* from the Theravadan *Vimāna Vatthu* shows that they not only knew of this common practice, they celebrated it.
