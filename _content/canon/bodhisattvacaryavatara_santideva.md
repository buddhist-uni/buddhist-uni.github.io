This epic poem on grasping firmly the intention to awaken has inspired many generations of Buddhists to live a more ethical and spiritual life and it captures beautifully the aesthetic of Buddhist ethics. Well worth reading again and again and again.

There are a few English translations of this classic of world literature. Steven Bachelor has a free translation (linked above), but I **strongly** prefer [the Padmakara translation](https://www.shambhala.com/the-way-of-the-bodhisattva-1660.html){:target="_blank"} published by [Shambhala]({% link _publishers/shambhala.md %}) in 1999 for its unparalleled accuracy and force.
