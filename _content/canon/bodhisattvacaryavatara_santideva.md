This epic poem on grasping firmly the intention to awaken has inspired many generations of Buddhists to live a more ethical and spiritual life and it captures beautifully the aesthetic of Buddhist ethics. Well worth reading again and again and again.

There are a few English translations of this classic of world literature. Steven Bachelor has a free translation [available online](https://www.tibethouse.jp/about/buddhism/text/pdfs/Bodhisattvas_way_English.pdf){:ga-event-value="3"}, but I strongly recommend the Padmakara translation published by Shambhala in 2011 for its unparalleled accuracy and force.
