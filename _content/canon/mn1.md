A challenging discourse (even for those who first heard it!), this first sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya is a forceful rejection of all forms of monism, and the Samkhya philosophy in particular.

For a translation of this sutta's semicanonical commentaries, see [Bhikkhu Bodhi's *The Root of Existence*](/content/monographs/mn1-cmy_bodhi).
