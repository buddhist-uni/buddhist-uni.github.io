> Being censured in this way by the Teacher, by wise companions in the holy life, by gods, and by himself, he realises no superhuman state, no distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why is that? That is how it is with one who does not fulfil the training in the Teacher’s Dispensation.

Venerable Bhaddāli refuses to follow the rule forbidding eating after noon, but is eventually filled with remorse and confesses to the Buddha who stresses the importance of following the monastic rules before forgiving him.
