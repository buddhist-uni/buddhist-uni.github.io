> ...the sign of the beautiful: frequently giving careless attention to it is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen sensual desire...

Just as the body depends on food, the hindrances and the awakening factors feed on specific nutriments.
In this sutta, the Buddha gives the specific condition for each of these mental qualities.
