> Although the early dictionaries, like [Pali Text Society](/publishers/pts)’s *[Pali-English Dictionary](/content/reference/ped)*
and [*A Critical Pāli Dictionary*](/content/reference/critical-pali-dictionary_pts), did utilize the Jātaka word definitions
considerably, up and till now no one has translated the word commentaries into
English in full. It is this gap that the present work seeks to fill with a new
translation of the 500 verses of the first three books, together with their
explanations, which takes us up to Jātaka 300.
