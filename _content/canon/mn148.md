The Buddha analyzes the six senses from six different perspectives and encourages us to see them all as "This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self."

> Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, eye contact, feeling, and craving. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed.
