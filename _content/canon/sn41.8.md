# unsure about which course. Also, I dislike "placing the mind and keeping it connected" here. Is there a better translation available?

The Jain leader Mahāvīra, known as Nigaṇṭha Nātaputa in the Buddhist tradition, is visited by Citta the Householder. Mahāvīra asks him whether he believes in a state of immersion free from thought. When Citta replies that he doesn’t, Mahāvīra is (prematurely) delighted. Citta goes on to explain that he needs no faith because he's already realized such a state himself in one of the most epic "mic-drops" of the Pāli Canon.
