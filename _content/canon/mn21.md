> ‘What the hell, Kāḷī!’

> Mendicants, there are these five ways in which others might criticize you. Their speech may be timely or untimely, true or false, gentle or harsh, beneficial or harmful, from a heart of love or from secret hate. When others criticize you, they may do so in any of these ways. If that happens, you should train like this: ‘Our minds will remain unaffected.’

> Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.

> If you frequently reflect on this advice--the simile of the saw--do you see any criticism, large or small, that you could not endure?"

A discourse full of vibrant and memorable images on the importance of patience and love even when faced with abuse and criticism.
