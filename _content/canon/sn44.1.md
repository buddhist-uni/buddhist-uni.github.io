> The Tathagata, great king, is liberated from reckoning in terms of consciousness; he is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom like the great ocean.

While staying in Toraṇavatthu, King Pasenadi wishes to visit a spiritual teacher, and the nun Khemā is highly recommended to him.
He asks her about whether a Realized One exists after death, and she says this is not answerable. Later he visits the Buddha, who replies in exactly the same way.
