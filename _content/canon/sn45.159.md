> Bhikkhus, suppose there is a guest house.
People come from the east, west, north, and south and lodge there;
khattiyas, brahmins, vessas...

Compare and contrast this sutta with [the famous Rumi poem (translated by Coleman Barks) of the same title](https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/guest-house/).
Does the poem illuminate anything about the sutta?
How does the sutta go beyond the poem?
