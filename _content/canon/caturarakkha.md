A late Pāli text that has been extremely influential on the (especially monastic) meditation practices of the Theravāda world, visible especially in Sri Lanka and Thailand today.

A discussion and Pāli edition of this text's (16th century? Cambodian?) commentary by Venerable Ñāṇamaṅgala can be found [on Academia.edu, here](https://www.academia.edu/38466468/An_Edition_and_Study_of_the_Buddh%C4%81nussati_in_the_P%C4%81li_Catur%C4%81rakkh%C4%81_a%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADhakath%C4%81).
