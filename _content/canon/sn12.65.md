The analogy of Nibbana as a lost city is given its earliest expression in this sutta, which beautifully tells of the Buddha's discovery of the Noble Path, and connects dependent arising to the Four Noble Truths, tying together all the Buddha's core teachings.

It is interesting to compare this sutta to [AN 5.71](/content/canon/an5.71) which seems to compare Enlightenment with tearing down a city.
