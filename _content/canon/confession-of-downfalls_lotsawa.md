> I confess each and every misdeed.  
I rejoice in all goodness.  
I request and pray to all the buddhas to teach and remain in saṃsāra.  
May I attain sublime, supreme, unsurpassed wisdom!

An short excerpt from the "Upāli's Questions Ascertaining the Vinaya Sūtra" (Toh68 *Vinayaviniścayopāli​paripṛcchāsūtra*) used as a repentance chant in the Tibetan Nyingma School.
