> Yet it is just within this fathom-long body, with its perception & intellect, that I declare that there is the cosmos, the origination of the cosmos, the cessation of the cosmos, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of the cosmos.

The god Rohitassa tells how he tried to go to the end of the world, and the Buddha explains how to do it successfully.

For Venerable Ä€nanda's own exegesis of this sutta, see [SN 35.116](/content/canon/sn35.116).
