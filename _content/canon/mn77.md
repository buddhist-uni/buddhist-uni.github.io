> And even those disciples of his who fall out with their companions in the holy life and abandon the training to return to the low life—even they praise the Master and the Dhamma and the Sangha; they blame themselves instead of others, saying: "We were unlucky, we have little merit"

The ascetic Sakuludāyin is amazed at how revered the Buddha is by his disciples, and the Buddha explains why his disciples love and respect him so dearly:

> Udāyin, when my disciples have met with suffering and become victims of suffering, prey to suffering, they come to me and ask me about the noble truth of suffering. Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of suffering, and I satisfy their minds

The Buddha then goes on to enumerate in detail the path of tranquility meditation and its fruits, including several uncommon lists, such as the eight liberations and the ten _kasiṇas_, the perfection of which is the ultimate reason the Sangha honors and respects their teacher.

Note that the "uncommon lists" here aren't found in [this sutta's Chinese parallel]({% link _content/articles/buddhas-truly-praiseworthy-qualities_analayo.md %}) and are somewhat out of proportion to the rest of the sutta, suggesting that they are late additions.
