> For Māra’s stream is breasted now  
And nullified, its reeds removed;  
Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily  
And set your hearts where safety lies.

Drawing parallels with a cowherd guiding his herd across a dangerous river, the Buddha presents the various kinds of enlightened disciples who cross the stream of transmigration.
