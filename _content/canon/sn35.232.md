> There exists in the Blessed One the eye, the Blessed One sees a form with the eye, yet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed One; the Blessed One is well liberated in mind.

Mahākoṭṭhita asks Sāriputta whether the interior and exterior sense fields are the fetters of each other. No; it is desire that is the fetter, like the yoke that binds two oxen. One with no desire still experiences the senses but without being fettered.
