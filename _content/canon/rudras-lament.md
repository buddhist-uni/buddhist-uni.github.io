> Kind protector, compassionate deity, heed me now, I pray

Notice how the self-empowering doctrine of Karma leaves a strong yearning for an external source of grace. A common trend in later Buddhisms was to provide such a God: either as a tantric Buddha, like here, or as a "distant" Buddha, like in the Amitabha and Maitreya cults.
