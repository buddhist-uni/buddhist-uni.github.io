A collection of 121 stories ostensibly from the Sarvāstivāda spanning from the time of Śākyamuni and his disciples to the era of King Kaniṣka and Aśvaghoṣa in the second century C.E.

The collection notably includes a northern version of Ven. Nāgasena’s conversion of King Milinda (111, Fascicle 9) as well as many stories about Gandhara.
