> … with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.

A "tremendously important" sutta showing how liberation is _also_ governed by the law of Dependent Origination.

For Bhikkhu Bodhi's commentary on this sutta, see [*Transcendental Dependent Arising*](/content/booklets/transcendantal-arising_bodhi).
