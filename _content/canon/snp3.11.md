> Knowledge of Silence I’ll convey,  
hard to do, to master difficult,  
so be both firm and resolute  
and I’ll speak upon this thing.

> Understand this by the way streams move  
in clefts and crevices:  
the little creeks flow on babbling,  
while silent flow the great rivers.  
>  
> What is unfilled makes noise  
but silent is what’s full,  
the fool is like the pot half-filled,  
the wise one is like a lake
