> Where dreadful serpents slither,  
where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders  
in the dark of the night;  
there meditates a mendicant

Brahmā Sahampati appears to the Buddha and speaks in praise of the renunciates staying fearless in the deep forest, and celebrates the many who have found freedom.
