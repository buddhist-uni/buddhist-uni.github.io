> ‘By this virtue or observance or asceticism or holy life I shall become a great god or some lesser god,’ that is wrong view in his case. Now there are two destinations for one with wrong view, I say: hell or the animal realm. So, _Puṇṇa_, if his dog-duty succeeds, it will lead him to the company of dogs; if it fails, it will lead him to hell.

It isn't just breaking the precepts that can lead one to hell. Contrary to contemporary ecumenical sensibilities, the Buddha pulled no punches condemning wrong view. What do you think makes wrong view so "wrong" in this case?
