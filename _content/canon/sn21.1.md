> Here, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhana, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. This is called noble silence.

Moggallāna reflects that the second absorption—where thought stops—is the true "noble silence," and the Buddha encourages him to develop it.
