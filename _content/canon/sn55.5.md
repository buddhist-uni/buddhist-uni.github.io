> Association with people of integrity, lord, is a factor for stream entry.

The Buddha asks Sāriputta about the four factors for stream-entry: association with good people, hearing the teaching, proper attention, and right practice. He also defines the “stream” and the “Sotāpanna” in this omnibus sutta on Sotāpatti.
