The Buddha lists the 32 Marks which Brahmanical prophecy claim marked him for greatness and explains the specific causes and results that each signify, in this late addition to the Canon.

See K.R. Norman's series of articles on [The Metres of the Lakkhaṇa Sutta](/content/booklets/metres-of-the-lakkhana-suttanta) for a discussion of this sutta's poetry.
