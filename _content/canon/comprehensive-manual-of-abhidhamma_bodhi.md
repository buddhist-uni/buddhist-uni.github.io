> The Abhidhamma’s attempt to comprehend the nature of reality,
contrary to that of classical science in the West, does not proceed from the
standpoint of a neutral observer looking outwards towards the external
world. The primary concern of the Abhidhamma is to understand the
nature of experience, and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious
reality, the world as given in experience, comprising both knowledge and
the known in the widest sense. For this reason the philosophical enterprise
of the Abhidhamma shades off into a phenomenological psychology.


This book is a translation of Ācariya Anuruddha's compendium, providing a concise summary of the Abhidhamma. It distills the key concepts of the system, organizing them for easy understanding. In many Buddhist countries, the Abhidhammattha Sangaha is considered essential for gaining insights into the Abhidhamma.
