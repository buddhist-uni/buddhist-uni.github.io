> Surely, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes.

The Buddha comes across three mendicants practicing diligently and harmoniously, and asks them how they do it.
They explain how they skillfully deal with the practical affairs of living together.
Only when pressed by the Buddha do they reveal their attainments.
