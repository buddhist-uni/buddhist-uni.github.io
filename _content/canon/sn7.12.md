> Again & again one wearies & trembles.  
Again & again the dullard goes to the womb.

A brahmin complains when the Buddha visits for alms many days in a row.
The Buddha takes the chance to point out that all natural phenomena repeat in cycles, and only an awakened one escapes the cycle of rebirth.
