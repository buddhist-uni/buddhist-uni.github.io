> For one reducing suffering like this *nibbāna* is said to be near.

Venerable Māluṅkyaputta asks for a teaching to take on retreat. The Buddha wonders how to teach an old monk like him, then questions him on his desire for sense experiences that have been or might be, and encourages him to simply let sense experiences be. Māluṅkyaputta says he understands, and expands on the Buddha’s teaching in a series of verses.
