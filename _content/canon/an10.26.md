> Some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal water to be the ultimate.

The female lay follower Kāḷī of Kuraraghara in Avantī asks Venerable Mahākaccāna about a verse spoken by the Buddha in “The Maidens’ Questions” ([SN 4.25](/content/canon/sn4.25)).
He replies unexpectedly in terms of the necessity of going beyond the ten kasinas to develop liberating insight.
