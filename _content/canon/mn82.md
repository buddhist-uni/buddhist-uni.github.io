> Then, not receiving his parents’ permission to go forth, the clansman Raṭṭhapāla lay down there on the bare floor, saying: "Right here I shall either die or receive the going forth."

This long sutta tells the story of Raṭṭhapāla's going forth: a model of monastic behavior for Theravādins even today.
