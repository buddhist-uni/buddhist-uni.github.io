> They had come to him glittering with beauty—  
Taṇha, Arati, and Raga—  
But the Teacher swept them away right there  
As the wind, a fallen cotton tuft.

Depressed, Māra laments to his three daughters of his failure to distract the Buddha.
So they take on the task themselves and assume a variety of sensuous forms to tempt him.
But they fail too, and Māra castigates them for being so presumptuous
