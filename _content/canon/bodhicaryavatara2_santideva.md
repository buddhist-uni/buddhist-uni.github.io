> Just as I must eventually forsake this life,  
So too must I take leave of relatives and friends.  
When I must go alone on death’s uncertain journey,  
What concern to me are all these enemies and allies?

A verse translation of chapter 2 from the [_Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra_](/content/canon/bodhisattvacaryavatara_santideva) on confessing to the wider universe of enlightened beings.
