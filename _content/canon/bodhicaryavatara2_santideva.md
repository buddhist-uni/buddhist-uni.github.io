> Just as I must eventually forsake this life,
So too must I take leave of relatives and friends.
When I must go alone on death’s uncertain journey,
What concern to me are all these enemies and allies?

A verse translation of chapter 2 from the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra on “Confession of Negativity.” the [_Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra_](/content/canon/bodhisattvacaryavatara_santideva)
