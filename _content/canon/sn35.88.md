> The people of Sunāparanta are wild and rough, Puṇṇa. If they abuse and insult you, what will you think of them?

Venerable Puṇṇa goes to the Buddha and asks for a teaching before he immigrates to a foreign land. The Buddha warns him that folk there are fierce, and questions whether he is ready for such a difficult assignment.
