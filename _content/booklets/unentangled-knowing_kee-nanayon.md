> When we say you have to endure, you really have to endure. Don’t be willing to surrender. Craving is going to keep coming up and whispering but don’t you listen to it! You have to listen to the Buddha—the Buddha who tells you to let go of craving.

A collection of teachings from one of 20th-century Thailand's preeminent nuns.
