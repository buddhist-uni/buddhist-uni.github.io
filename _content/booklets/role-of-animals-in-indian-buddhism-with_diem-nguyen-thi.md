> Buddhism perceives animals as if they were young children who do not
have the intellectual capacity to understand the world as intelligently as
humans and just like children need to be protected by humans. As human are
the most intelligent beings on planet earth and control almost everything, they
have a responsibility toward rest of the flora and fauna.
