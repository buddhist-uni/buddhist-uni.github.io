The Verses of the Senior Nuns, found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon, is a collection of approximately 524 verses attributed to 73 senior nuns who lived during the Buddha’s time, with a few from slightly later periods. These verses express the joy of spiritual attainments and gratitude for the guidance and teaching of fellow nuns. The Therīgāthā is one of the earliest spiritual texts that exclusively records the voices of women. This fresh translation by Bhikku Sujato also offers an informative introduction to the text.
