My favorite translation of the Dhammapada, including accurate summaries of the stories that traditionally accompanied the verses—some of the most beloved commentarial stories in all of Buddhism.

The older, Bhante Narada version of the book can be acquired in physical form **for free** via [the Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation](https://www-old.budaedu.org/en/book/).
