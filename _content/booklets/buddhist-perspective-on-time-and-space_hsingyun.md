> Our daily lives in the vast universe are integrally related to and can never be separated from time and space. How successful a person is and how effective one handles one’s affairs depend on one’s management of interpersonal relationships, one’s utilization of time, and one’s allocation of space.

Through numerous, and some humorous, stories, Master Hsing Yun explains time and space from a Buddhist perspective and how practitioners must transcend their limitations in order to "seize eternity within an instant and to see the wondrous reality in each flower, each tree, each body of water, and each rock."
