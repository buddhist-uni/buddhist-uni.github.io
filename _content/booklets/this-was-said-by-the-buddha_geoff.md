> Whatever the history of the text, though, it has long been one of the favorite collections in the Pali canon, for it covers a wide range of the Buddha's teachings — from the simplest to the most profound — in a form that is accessible, appealing, and to the point.



This is Thānissaro Bhikkhu's 2001 translation of the Itivuttaka, a collection of 112 suttas found in the Khuddaka Nikāya, part of the larger Sutta Piṭaka of the Pāli Canon. Thānissaro's translation is crisp and concise and offers useful footnotes in many places, elucidating many sticking points for Buddhist practitioners.
