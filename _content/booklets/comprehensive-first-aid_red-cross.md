What everyone should know about how to respond to various medical problems and emergencies.

The above-linked guide is the 2018, Canadian edition which is quite thorough.

The Red Cross in other countries have their own guides.
For example, here are the 2020 guidebook for
[Singapore](https://redcross.sg/images/pdfs/SFA-Manual-Rev-1-2020_final.pdf)
and [India's 2024 Manual](https://ircsstoragedev.blob.core.windows.net/wordpresswebsite/2024/03/FA-manual-1.pdf).

The U.S. American Red Cross also has First Aid [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/first-aid-by-british-red-cross/id483408666) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cube.arc.fa) apps.
