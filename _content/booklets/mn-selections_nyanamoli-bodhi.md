A Creative Commons licensed selection of suttas from [Wisdom's celebrated translation]({% link _content/monographs/mn_nyanamoli-bodhi.md %}), representing about a third of the full book.

It's still highly recommended that you get the monograph though, as many important suttas are missing from this anthology and the endnotes and introductions in the original are quite helpful.
