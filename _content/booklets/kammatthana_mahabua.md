> We must use *sati-paññā* to sound out and see the *dukkha*. To see clearly the heat with insight. Then turn to see our Heart – is that also red-hot as well? Or is it only the body parts (*dhātu-khandha*) that are heated? If one possesses discernment then the Heart will not be moved. It will be cool within the mass of fire which is the body burning with the fires of *dukkha*. This is the way of those who practise.

A series of fiery and inspiring Dhamma talks from Thailand's famed forest master on the subject of meditation: starting with the foundation of *samatha* and dwelling at length on the correct way to develop *vipassana* and *paññā*.
