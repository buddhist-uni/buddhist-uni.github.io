> The concept of the Paccekabuddha presented the
opportunity to include pre-Buddhist recluses and seers in
Buddhism and in doing so it continued these pre-Buddhist
traditions. In this respect it becomes clear why
Paccekabuddhas are referred to in the scriptures with all
other terms that could be used to denote ascetics: muni, isi,
samaṇa, tāpasa, jaṭila, terms which emphasise different
aspects of asceticism

An in-depth study of the Paccekabuddha as described in Pali Canonical and Commentarial Literature.
This includes pre-Buddhist ideas of sages, i.e. munis, and the importance given to renunciation and solitude in the suttas.
Also, this work looks at a Paccekabuddha's way of life and meditation practices, leading to nibbāna. As the Buddha tells us, "no one but me equals a paccekabuddha" (Isigili Sutta).
