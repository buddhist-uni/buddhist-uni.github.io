> The insight exercises can be practised not only in solitude,
as is necessary in the case of the exercise of calm or samatha, but they can be practised everywhere. Maturity of
knowledge is the main thing required. For if knowledge is
ripe, the insight of impermanence may easily be
accomplished while listening to a discourse or while living a
householder’s ordinary life.

In this work, Ledi Sayadaw explores topics such as the distortions of perception (vipallasa), the conceivings (mannana), the stages (bhumi), the Noble Truths (sacca), the causes of phenomena, the higher knowledges, Nibbana, and more. Each subject is thoroughly explained and accompanied by concise descriptions, some taken from the Pali texts and others drawn from Ledi Sayadaw's own teachings.
