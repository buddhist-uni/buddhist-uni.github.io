An excoriating but faithful look "behind the scenes" at some of the problems of contemporary Theravada in South(east) Asia.

While I disagree strongly with many of Bhante Dhammika's proposed "solutions" (and even a few of his "problems") I still think that the issues raised are important enough to be worth a read.
I especially recommend this book to Westerners considering ordination, as disillusionment is a common problem for us converts: an issue best addressed directly, whilst faith is still strong.
