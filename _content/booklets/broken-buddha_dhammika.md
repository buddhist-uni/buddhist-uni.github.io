An excoriating but faithful look "behind the scenes" at some of the problems of contemporary Theravada in South(east) Asia.

While I disagree strongly with many of Bhante Dhammika's proposed "solutions" (and even a few of his "problems!") I still recommend this book highly to those interested in getting to know the "real" Theravada.
