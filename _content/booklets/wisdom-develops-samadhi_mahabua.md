One of the few books written directly by Luangdta, this meditation manual represents some of his clearest advice on developing the path.

> The heart which is not controlled by a _kammaṭṭhāna_ is liable to the arising of "exuberance" throughout life [...which] has been the enemy of all beings for countless ages, and a person who wants to subdue the "outgoing exuberance" of his own heart will need to compel his heart to take the medicine – which is the _kammaṭṭhāna_.
