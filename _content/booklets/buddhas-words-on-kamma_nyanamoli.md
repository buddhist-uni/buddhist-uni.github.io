> Now a great producer of happiness is the making of good kamma. What is good about it? It is rooted in non-greed (generosity, renunciation), or in non-hate (loving kindness, compassion) or finally in non-delusion (wisdom, understanding). 

In this booklet, Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli Thera offers a translation of Majjhima Nikaya [57](/content/canon/mn57), [135](/content/canon/mn135), [136](/content/canon/mn136), and [41](/content/canon/mn41) with a brief introduction to each sutta, highlighting the importance of wholesome states of mind, right intention, and right mindfulness in generating good kamma. There is also a short but humorous and insightful preface.
