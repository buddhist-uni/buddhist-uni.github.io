> Three interpretations of
bhavaṅga have been taken up for discussion. One is as found in the Netti that *bhavaṅga*
designates each link of twelve factors of dependent co-arising in the context of *āsava*, which 
together produce *bhava.*
Psychological and cosmological interpretations of bhava have been 
studied. [...]
The third interpretation occurs in the commentaries that bhavaṅga-consciousness is 
luminous and pure, it is a natural consciousness and all beings pass away with this state of 
consciousness.
