This is Bhante Sujato's 2018 translation and presentation of the enitre Udāna—part of the Pāli Canon's Khuddaka Nikaya. The collection delves into meditation, wisdom, and freedom through stories, loosely structured to trace the life of the Buddha. It presents ethical lessons, celebrations of liberation, and thoughtful reflections on the nature of Nibbāna.
