> The prince (Asoka) fitted out a great army consisting of the four parts, and then
went forth, taking with him a branch of the Bo tree of the Tathagata.  
Having passed through three kingdoms and the Vinjha range, having passed
through the great forest, the prince came to the ocean.  
The great four-fold army with the Bhikkhuni congregation at its head,
proceeded to the great sea, carrying the excellent Bo tree.  

Edited by Ayya Tathaaloa, this booklet consists of selected verses from the Dīpavaṃsa, the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. These selecteion come from the Hermann Oldenberg's 1879 translation. Further, these selections cover King Ashoka's conversion, Mahinda's conversion of the island, as well as praises of the Buddha and Sangha while capturing the presence and importance of bhikkhunis.
