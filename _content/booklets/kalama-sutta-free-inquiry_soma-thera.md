A translation of [the K훮l훮ma Sutta](/content/canon/an3.65) with a brief preface which explains that the importance of the sutta lies in its encouragement of inquiry into the dhamma.

For an alternate understanding of this sutta, [Evans, 2007](/content/articles/doubting-kalama-sutta_stephen-a-evans).
