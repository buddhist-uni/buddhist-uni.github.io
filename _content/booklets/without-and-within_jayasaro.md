> This book is intended to provide an introduction to the teachings of the Buddha which will shed some light on a subject that, to non-Buddhists, can appear both unexpectedly rational and exotically strange.

A consise and admirable introduction to Theravada Buddhism by one of Thailand's most charismatic converts.
