A straightforward, Q&A-style introduction to Buddhism.

The Q&A format of this booklet is quite easy to skim, making it an excellent primer for those who have a bit of background knowledge already. Written from the Western, Tibetan perspective, it also has an admirably wide scope, covering questions about Tibetan and Mahayana Buddhism without disparaging the Theravada perspective.
