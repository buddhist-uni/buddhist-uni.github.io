> In the teaching of my Guru, my mind is always happy.  
Singing songs of inspiration, my mouth is always happy.  
Wearing cotton from Nepal, my body’s always happy.  
In delight I accomplish all and everything—  
To me there is but cheer and joy.  

This work is a collection of 60 songs by Milarepa, Tibet's revered 11th-century yogi and saint. Translated by Garma C.C. Chang, the work displays Milarepa's spiritual insights in accessible verses, covering themes like impermanence, renunciation, and the nature of suffering.
