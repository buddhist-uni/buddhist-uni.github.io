> In the same way, one who has attained to the ultimate truth sees that there's no such thing as ‘religion.’ There is only a certain nature which can be called whatever we like. We can call it ‘Dhamma,’ we can call it ‘Truth,’ we can call it ‘God,’ ‘Tao,’ or whatever, but we shouldn't particularize that Dhamma or that Truth as Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, Judaism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, or Islam, for we can neither capture nor confine it with labels and concepts.

In this 1967 discussion with laywomen in Bangkok, Venerable Buddhadasa explores themes of religious pluralism, the nature of language, and the essence of religious experience. He presents the thought-provoking thesis that true awakening transcends conventional boundaries of religion, leading to a state of "no-religion."
