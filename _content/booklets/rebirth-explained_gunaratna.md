> An understanding of rebirth will not only induce a refining
influence on oneâ€™s own life, it will also refine his attitude
towards all sentient beings without a single exception, since
he will realize that all are his fellow-passengers in the great
journey of life, subject to the same universal laws and
fundamental principles to which he himself is subject.

A rigorous study of rebirth from a purely Buddhist perspective, in which the author highlights how a firm understanding of rebirth is essential to practicing the Dhamma.
