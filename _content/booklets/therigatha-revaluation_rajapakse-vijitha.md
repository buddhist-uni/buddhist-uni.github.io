>Notable cross-culturally conceived feminist critiques of this decade show no awareness of
Thī (Therīgāthā), and the characteristic preoccupations with
womanhood and the feminine that come to the fore in this
setting are also apt to be overlooked in conventional
expositions of Buddhist thought (where sensitivity to
gender considerations is still non-existent or inchoate).

This work takes a closer look at the Therīgāthā, songs of the elder nuns, found in the Pāli Canon. In particular, this book highlights an early Buddhist strain of feminism, not one directly dealing with the rights of women but on the importance of the feminine perspective.
