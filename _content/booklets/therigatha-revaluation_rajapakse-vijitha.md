>Notable cross-culturally conceived feminist critiques of this decade show no awareness of
Therīgāthā and the characteristic preoccupations with
womanhood and the feminine that come to the fore in this
setting are also apt to be overlooked in conventional
expositions of Buddhist thought.

This work takes a closer look at the Therīgāthā, songs of the elder nuns, found in the Pāli Canon giving an introductory analysis from both the feminist and Buddhist perspectives.
