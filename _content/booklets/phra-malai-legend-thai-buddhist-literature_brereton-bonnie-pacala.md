> The oldest known copy of this text at
the present time, and possibly also the oldest extant book
written in a Thai language, is a palm leaf manuscript with a
Chula Sakkarad date corresponding to 1516 A.D. Written in
the Tham script, the treatise employs a dual language format
consisting of Pali passages followed by their Lan Na Thai
equivalents

This dissertation is a scholarly study of the story of the Arhat Maliyadeva, found in its oldest Thai rescension. This story is traditionaly found in the Vessantara JƒÅtaka. Looking at two other later editions, the study examines various meaning and uses of the story in different contexts for different purposes. Also included is a translation of the highly literary Kham Luang (royal version) of the story.
