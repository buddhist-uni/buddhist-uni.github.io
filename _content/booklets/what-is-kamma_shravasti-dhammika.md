> Mah훮n훮ma once confided to the Buddha his anxiety about dying at a time when his mind was
confused and bewildered (musati), thinking it might result in him having a negative rebirth.
The Buddha reassured him that because he had developed various spiritual qualities for a long
time, he had nothing to fear if such a thing should happen.

In this short booklet, Dhammika gives an explanation of kamma  and its ripening (vip훮ka). This is followed by showing how kamma plays a role in developing the mind, rebirth, and nibb훮na.
