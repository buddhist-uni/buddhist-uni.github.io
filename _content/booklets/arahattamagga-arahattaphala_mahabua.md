An extremely profound and exceptionally rare book, *Arahattamagga* gives an unfiltered first-hand account of what it's actually like to walk the entire Path—from its tumultuous beginning to its extraordinary finish.

The book includes detailed descriptions of the qualia of the different stages of enlightenment, along with the insights and practices relevant to each stage. Far from a technical manual though, this book is a hugely inspiring and approachable series of straightforward conversations. A beginning practitioner will benefit immensely from hearing how possible enlightenment is, but it is the most advanced practitioners (think: *sakadāgāmī* / *anāgāmī* already) who will reap the highest reward from *Arahattamagga*: *Arahattaphala*.
