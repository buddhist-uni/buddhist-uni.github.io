In the 1970s, Ajahn Brahm began writing his own translation of and commentary on the *Vinaya* in order to support his fellow, Western monks who, at the time, lacked such a resource in English. 

Ajahn Geoff eventually picked up the project and took it [in his own direction (resulting in the now-famous BMC)](/content/booklets/bmc_geoff), but these original notes remain a solid resource for practical vinaya, alongside [Bhante Suddhaso's more recent translation of the *Vibhaṅga*](/content/canon/analysis-of-the-bhikkhu-patimokkha_suddhaso).
