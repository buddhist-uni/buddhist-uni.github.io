> A full meal is best enjoyed on an empty stomach. And the suttas
will fill our minds and hearts, but only if we respect their empty
spaces.

This is Bhikkhu Sujato's 2020 translation of the Itivuttaka, a collection of 112 suttas found in the Khuddaka Nikāya, part of the larger Sutta Piṭaka of the Pāli Canon. This translation is part of Sutta Central's large project of translating the four Pali Nikāyas with the aim of presenting plain, approachable English and consistent terminology.
