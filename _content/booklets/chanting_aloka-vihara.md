The devotional used for daily chanting at Āloka and Karuṇā Vihāras in California, derived from the Thai style and adapted for use by the American Bhikkhunis.

With the exception of the Heart Sutra (and certain Pāli phrases in their feminine variants) this book represents a fairly typical Theravāda chanting manual.
