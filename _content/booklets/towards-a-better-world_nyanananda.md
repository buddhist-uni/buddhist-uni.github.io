> … without showing any disrespect simply because it is worded in Sinhala, if you listen to this marvellous Dhamma with worshipful devotion and gladness, you will surely gain heavenly bliss

A Sinhalese poem on the dangers of Saṃsāra and the benefits of the practice, showing that the southern lineage of Buddhism also had a thriving literary tradition.
