> Ānanda’s tears and the Buddha’s expression of gratitude and thanks are testament to the close bond between the two men, one that went beyond their kin relationship.

A down-to-earth biography of the Buddha based on the Pāli Canon.

An interactive, electronic edition can be read [online here](https://wiswo.org/books/footprints/)
and you can see a short (20-minute) interview with Bhante about the book [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/QWvbu4bmQLM) to get an idea of its contents and his humanistic approach.
