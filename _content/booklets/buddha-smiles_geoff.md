> the Buddha himself rarely smiles in the Canon, and when he does, the reasons for his smile are never hilarious.  Still, the Canon’s reputation for being devoid of humor is undeserved. It’s there in the Canon, but it often goes unrecognized.   


An anthology of humorous stories from the Pali Canon, which makes the collection less intimidating and more approachable. Recommended for people just starting to read the canon, and wondering where to start.

The book may have been inspired by [this 1981 paper in JPTS](https://archive.org/download/jpts-ix-1981/Humor%20in%20Pali%20Literature%20-%20Walpola%20Rahula_text.pdf){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.35"} by [Walpola Rahula](/authors/rahula-w).
