An excellent primer introducing, step-by-step, the basic grammatical concepts essential to understanding the Pāli language. 

This _Primer_ makes its concepts approachable and fun, and sets the student up well for studying more advanced textbooks, such as [Warder](https://audiobuddha.org/introduction-to-pali/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="2.5"} or [Duroiselle](https://web.archive.org/web/20090130021516/http://www.pratyeka.org/duroiselle/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="2.5"}, later.  You can get [the book's answer key here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hLYzGwKUYhWR2J0J1L3zIK67VsFzv6j4/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="2"}.
