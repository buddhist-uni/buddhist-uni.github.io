> Of course, one who dies while sitting in zazen will never be unhappy. But it is nearly impossible to die in this manner if your body is suffering the pain of sickness. My own master (Gudō Kokushi) said, 'Your zazen for one sitting is a lifetime of zazen.' How edifying these words of his are.

A collection of short teachings to "seekers who would desire to go in the same way" originally compiled in 1670.

The translation here was published by The Eastern Buddhist in three installments in 1970 and 1971:
  1. New Series vol 3 n 2, pp. 89–118
  2. New Series vol 4 n 1, pp. 116–123
  3. New Series vol 4 n 2, pp. 119–127  

They are gathered here into a single PDF for your convenience.
