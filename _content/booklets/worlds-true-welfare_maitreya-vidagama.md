> Learn well yourself this Law  
That the Blessed One has taught;  
Teach it to others in compassionate love  
By the results of skillful acts performed.  
Bar forever the roads to realms of woe

A 15th century, Sri Lankan poem beautifully exhorting the listener to the ethical life and to right view.

Listen to the poem [in the original Sinhala on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Lo-Weda-Sangarawa){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"}.

And if this poetic translation is a bit hard to follow, see the more prosaic translation, [*Towards a Better World*](/content/booklets/towards-a-better-world_nyanananda).
