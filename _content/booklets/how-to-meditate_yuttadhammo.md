My most highly recommended introduction to Buddhist meditation.

Transcribed from [a series of YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL603BD0B03E12F5A1){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ page.base_value }}"}, this short booklet concisely describes the practice as it's taught in the [Mahasi](/authors/mahasi) [vipassana](/tags/vipassana) tradition.

For those practicing intensively according to this booklet, I encourage you to [sign up for one-on-one instruction here](https://meditation.sirimangalo.org/course){:ga-event-value="2" target="_blank"}.

There is also [a sequel to this booklet](/content/booklets/htm2_yuttadhammo).
