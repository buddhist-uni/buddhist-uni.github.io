> It is an early Sanskrit poem written in India on the legendary history of Buddha, and therefore contains much that is of interest for the history of Buddhism, besides its special importance as illustarating the early history of classical Sanskrit literature.

A more contemporary (2009) translation by Charles Willemen from the (arguably more faithful) Chinese recension of the text (Taishō 4 192) can be [downloaded here](https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Translations/Buddhacarita_2009.pdf){:ga-event-value="3.5"} courtesy of BDK.
