> The obsession with seeing portions of the Suttanipāta as early
is a holdover of the mid-20th century enthusiasm for discovering
a “Buddha before Buddhism”, seeking a “truly authentic” teaching
before it was institutionalized as rigid doctrine. Somehow, this
search always ends up conflated with the racially-charged effort to
divest Buddhism of its “cultural” (read “Asian”) elements. The Suttanipāta does not need rescue, and a romanticizing and reductive
lens adds nothing and distorts much.

This collection of teachings from the Suttanipāta contains 74 short texts in verse or mixed prose and verse, arranged in five chapters. It contains some of the most well-known texts in popular Buddhism, such as the Ratana, Maṅgala, and Mettā Suttas, and texts such as the “Rhinoceros Horn” and the “Way to the Beyond” are regarded as among the earliest of the Buddhist scriptures.
