> In certain cases
I found that it was possible to clear up perceived difficulties without too
much trouble. In other cases, the more I looked, the more problematic the
texts became. So this work is concerned with problem-solving: looking at
difficult or controversial areas, highlighting the most accurate textual data,
and looking at different possibilities for interpretation. It is not meant to
be a guide to monastic conduct, and does not attempt to be complete or
systematic. Along the way I offer a little advice for those seeking practical
guidance. Usually, despite the forbidding textual complexities, the ethical
issues are really quite simple.
