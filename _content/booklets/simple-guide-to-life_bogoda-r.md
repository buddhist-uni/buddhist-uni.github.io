> This essay will help the Buddhist lay follower to understand, from a practical angle, the main points of the Buddhaâ€™s teachings as they bear on the conduct of daily life. Constant practice of these principles will ensure that they are built into his character, enabling him to develop into a well-rounded human being, a centre of sanity in a confused world adrift in fashionable philosophies full of empty promises.
