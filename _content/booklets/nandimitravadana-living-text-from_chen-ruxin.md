> This dissertation offers a comprehensive treatment of the textual sources of the Nandimitrāvadāna, a Buddhist narrative which is deemed an authoritative source for the cult of the Elders or Arhats in Central and East Asia.

> Putting all the three (i.e., Khotanese, Tibetan, Chinese) versions of the Nandimitrāvadāna under philological  and historical scrutiny, the dissertation draws attention to the interplay  between the fluid text and the cultic practice, and sheds light on the  complexity of the tradition as well as the reception of the narrative in  various cultural spheres.
