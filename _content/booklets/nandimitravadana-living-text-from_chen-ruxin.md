> This dissertation offers a comprehensive treatment of the  textual sources of the Nandimitrāvadāna, a Buddhist narrative which is deemed  an authoritative source for the cult of the Elders or Arhats in Central and East Asia.
> It is not only the first monographic study of this narrative and  its textual history, but also the first systematic disquisition on living  texts from the Buddhist tradition, a type of Buddhist texts that seem to lack a stable text-form and a unitary authorship.
> Putting all the three (i.e.,  Khotanese, Tibetan, Chinese) versions of the Nandimitrāvadāna under philological  and historical scrutiny, the dissertation draws attention to the interplay  between the fluid text and the cultic practice, and sheds light on the  complexity of the tradition as well as the reception of the narrative in  various cultural spheres.
