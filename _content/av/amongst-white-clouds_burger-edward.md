> You live in the mountains a few years
and then you go into town, you sit on the bus...
you look at all those people and you feel,
'Who are you struggling for?'

> It's not easy I tell you.  
If you can live here,  
you're sure to arrive  
in the Pure Land.

A disciple of the hermits of the Zhongnan Mountains introduces us to the lifestyle and wisdom of his masters.
