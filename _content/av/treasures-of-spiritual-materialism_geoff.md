> They are a kind of spiritual materialism, but they are a good kind—the kind you work at developing, the kind you can amass. And there is no greed in amassing them. It's a sign of initiative. A sign of the right effort.

In this dhamma talk at the Insight Meditation Center in Barre, Massachusetts, Ahjan Geoff explains that not all spiritual materialism is incorrect. He lists five treasures (conviction, virtue, shame, compunction, generosity, learning, and discernment) that, when cultivated, lead a practitioner toward nibbāna and also benefit others.
