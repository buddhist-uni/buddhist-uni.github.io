In this podcast, Dr. Geoff Barstow discusses his journey as a Tibetan Buddhism scholar, the complex status of animals in Buddhism, and his research on vegetarianism in Tibet. He explores how viewing the world through the lens of animals can offer new insights and addresses questions about the Buddha's teachings on animals, vegetarianism among Buddhists, and the interactions between Buddhist communities and animals.
