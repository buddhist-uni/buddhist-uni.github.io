A series of Dhamma talks delivered to series beginners over the course of a few months in 2009. The talks give a penetrating introduction to the essence of the teachings and are recommended for all.

I have reordered and renumbered [the original lectures]({{ page.source_url }}){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ page.base_value | times: 0.5 }}"} according to the chapters in [_Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path_]({% link _content/booklets/buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita.md %}) which they best correspond with, creating a more gradual and sensible order to the lecture series than you'll find online. It's therefore recommended that you listen to them in the order [provided on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6om_MKaiwvOHKUZMS-6pUEBAhAwtL06){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="{{ page.base_value }}"}, rather than chronologically.
