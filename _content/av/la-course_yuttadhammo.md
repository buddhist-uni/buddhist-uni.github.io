I have reordered and renumbered the lectures according to the chapters in "Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path" that they best correspond with, creating a more gradual and sensible order to the lecture series. It's highly recommended that you listen to them in the order [provided on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6om_MKaiwvOHKUZMS-6pUEBAhAwtL06), rather than chronologically.
