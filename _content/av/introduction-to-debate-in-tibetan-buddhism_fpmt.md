In this short video, Sera IMI monks Venerables Gache, Legtsok, and Lekden offer an introduction to Tibetan Buddhist debate, along with a brief demonstration. Debate is a lively and important part of monastic education, especially for monks studying Buddhist philosophy in monastic colleges. It helps deepen understanding and sharpen critical thinking.
