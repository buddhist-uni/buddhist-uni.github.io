> Mythology isn't about "should." It's about "is." It's about describing life.

Bhante Sujato explains how Buddhist myths work: the ground the stories grew out of and how they were reshaped by Buddhist wisdom.

Note that you can feel free to skip the fourth lecture as it doesn't add much to the previous three.

The classes can also be viewed [as Youtube videos here](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/ajahn-sujato-buddhist-mythology-the-sacred-and-the-profane/13132/1).
