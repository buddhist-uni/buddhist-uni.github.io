This documentary explores the temple of Banteay Chhmar, an 800-year-old complex that was once a jewel of the Khmer Empire. Over time, it became largely forgotten except by the local people, but is now slowly being rediscovered. The film follows the lives of a Cambodian family living near the complex, highlighting the role the temple grounds play in their life and culture.
