The 500-year history of world maps in Buddhist Japan and what these maps tell us about the Japanese, Buddhist identity.

This interview explores David Max Moermanâ€™s study of the largely unknown history of Japanese, Buddhist world maps.
His work uncovers an alternative history of Japanese Buddhism shaped by a Buddhist geographic imaginary that engaged multiple cartographic and cosmological worldviews.
