> Shinjin is the true cause of birth in the Purland.

This talk by Rev. Miyaji first discusses how Jodo Shinshu Buddhists do not believe in luck and astrology, but rather, they follow closely the principle of cause and effect. In part two, Miyaji explains how karma is understood from a self-power and other-power perspective. Rebirth into the Pureland depends on faith in the loving compassion of Amitabha Buddha, therefor merit and demerit do not bar a person from entry. Yet, when this loving compassion is fully understood, a person does not want to perform negative actions.
