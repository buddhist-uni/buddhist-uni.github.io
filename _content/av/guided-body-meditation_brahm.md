Some gentle banter, a relaxing, guided body-scan meditation, capped off with instructions on releasing the mind.

The meditation was followed with the answers to a few questions, including whether "sending metta" to an ill person makes a difference, on having many teachers, and the role of ethics ("sÄ«la") in meditation.
