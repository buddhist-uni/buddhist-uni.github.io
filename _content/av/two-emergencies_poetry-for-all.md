> Why not  
tend to your own horse

A poem in response to
[Auden's poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/159364/musee-des-beaux-arts-63a1efde036cd){:target="_blank"}
about
[Bruegel's painting](https://www.artchive.com/artwork/landscape-with-the-fall-of-icarus-by-pieter-bruegel-the-elder/){:target="_blank"}
about
[the fall of Icarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus){:target="_blank"}
asking what it is that we owe one another
and what is the correct response to the tragedy of craft.
