An in-depth presentation of early Southeast Asian art from 2,000 BCE, the start of the Bronze Age, to the 8th century CE. Brown divides his presentation into three periods. First is the Indiegenous Bronze Age, around 2000 BCE; second, Indian contact, 2nd century CE to 5th century CE; third, Indian-related art, 5th century onward. While showcasing the art of early Southeast Asia and its history, Brown explores topics such as the lack of diety images in Indigenous art, the transition to such images in artwork, and some hypotheses of how this could and could not have come about.
