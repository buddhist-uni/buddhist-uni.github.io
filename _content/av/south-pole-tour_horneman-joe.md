A tour of the cozy, U.S.-operated research station located at the South Pole.

Linked above is part 1, here is [the link to part 2](https://youtu.be/b1ZMsOJ7lWg), and here [is the link to part 3](https://youtu.be/pWtHMBssWvg).
I'd also recommend topping the series off with [his tour of the IceCube facility](https://youtu.be/gLbegYWCqkg) which is the largest experiment at the South Pole and an example of the science they can do there that would be impossible to do elsewhere.
