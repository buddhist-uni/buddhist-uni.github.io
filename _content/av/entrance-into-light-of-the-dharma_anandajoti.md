This is a translation of chapter 4 of the Lalitavistara Sūtra, a Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhist sutra, by Ānandajoti Bhikkhu. In this chapter, the Bodhisattva gives a dharma teaching to the gods in Tushita just before his imminent rebirth, in which he will attain full awakening, becoming the Buddha Shakyamuni. The teaching is presented as a list of the main mental states and factors to be developed for awakening.
