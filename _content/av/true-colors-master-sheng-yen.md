> If we don't freeze to death in the winter and don't die of hunger on the other days, that's good enough.

A loving biography of a modern Chan Master who faced many challenges in his mission to revitalize authentic, Chinese Buddhism.

For his offical autobiography, see [*Footprints in the Snow* (2008)](/content/monographs/footprints-in-the-snow_shen-yen).
