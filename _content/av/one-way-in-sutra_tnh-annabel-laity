> Bhikkus, relying on this one way of entering the path, living beings are purified,
freed from sorrow and anxiety, their minds no longer subject to agitation, their
understanding stable, and they are able to realize nirvāṇa.

A translation of of the One Way In Sutra which teaches mindfulness of body, feelings, mind, awakening factors, and the jhanas in order to be tranquil and reach nirvāṇa.
