> Today you have to understand charity if you want to understand Buddhism.

> [Charities in the event-network style] emphasize *not* staying to talk… so you’re not creating more karmic entanglement… whereas the Cherish Children Fund… created long-term sustained relationships… as a form of collective karma.

> People are doing very different types of projects for very different reasons... [But] feelings of care, feelings of selflessness were key ways that people demonstrated themselves as good people... ensuring that they were making merit.
