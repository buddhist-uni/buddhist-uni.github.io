> Build your home. Let go. Let go until the mind reaches the peace that is free from advancing, free from retreating and free from stopping still.

This is a reading of Ajahn Chah's sermon to an aged lay follower by Ajahn Amaro. Here, Ajahn Chah gives advice such as letting go of the declining body, reciting Buddho, and seeing the impermanence of all things.
