> Look at the body with wisdom and realize this.
If your house is flooded or burnt to the ground, whatever the threat to it, let it concern only the house.
If there's a flood, don't let it flood your mind.
If there's a fire, don't let it burn your heart.
Let it be merely the house which is outside of you that is flooded or burned.
Now is the time to allow the mind to let go of its attachments.

Ajahn Chah gives an inspiring talk to a dying disciple.
