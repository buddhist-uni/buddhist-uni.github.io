> We see all kinds of orientations, where someone's neck is twisted, you can see their chin is pointing right, the chin is pointing left, the chin is pointing up... I see everybody misaligned in some gross or subtle way.

A scholar and practitioner of Chinese medicine talks about how the psychological problems that can arise in meditation often have their start, or at least early warning signs, in the body, and how a more careful attention to our bones and muscles—as well as our physical and social environments—can prevent many cases of "meditation sickness."
