> It's the same vows, but the volume is turned up, if I may say so.

An anthropologist and Buddhist practitioner discusses her field work at the meditation center of Lapchi in Kham ཁམས (Yushu ཡུལ་ཤུལ་ Prefecture, Qinghai 青海).
She discusses how the strict ascetic practices of Master Tsultrim Tarchen are inspiring a new generation of Tibetan Buddhists,
touching on the role of charisma in perpetuating the Dharma
and on the paradoxically social nature of renunciation.
