> If you don't feel challenged by the text, then the text isn't doing its work.

> ... but I feel my life has been enriched by having these verses come bubble up in my mind.

This talk took place at the Insight Meditation Center in Barre, MA, in 2005, as a book launch for Gil Fronsdal's then-newly published translation of the Dhammapada. In his talk, Fronsdal gives context to the Dhammapada and proceeds to read various verses and explain them, giving a broad flavor of the work.
