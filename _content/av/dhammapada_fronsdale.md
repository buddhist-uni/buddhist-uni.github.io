This talk took place at the Insight Meditation Center in Barre, MA, in 2005, as a book launch for Gil Fronsdal's then-newly published translation of the Dhammapada. In his talk, Fronsdal gives context to the Dhammapada and proceeds to read various verses and explain them, giving a broad flavor of the work.
