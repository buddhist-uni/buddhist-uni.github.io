> To contend seriously with the problem, you first have to let it in. And when I say "let it in" I mean "drag it towards you, press it down and sit with it." Sit with it past the point of discomfort and pain and dispair until you can observe it without blinking, until its weight is just another thing about about you. In a way, "letting in" is too passive. What I'm talking about is fitting a hyperobject into your heart without it breaking.
