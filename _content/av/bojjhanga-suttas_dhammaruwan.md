In the early 1970s, a young Sri Lankan boy named Dhammaruwan spontaneously recalled huge amounts of PƒÅli chanting. Eventually, his father gave the boy a tape recorder, and this haunting, beautiful chant was recorded some evening later. Recently, textual scholarship by Analayo Bhikkhu has suggested the memory may be from over a thousand years ago (see [_Rebirth in Early Buddhism_](https://wisdomexperience.org/product/rebirth-early-buddhism-and-current-research/)).
