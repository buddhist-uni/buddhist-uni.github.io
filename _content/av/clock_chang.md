> Once I heard a scientist with  
Alzheimerâ€™s on the radio, trying to  
figure out why he could no longer  
draw a clock.

A poem based on [this radio show about a scientist losing his mind to dimentia](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/583/itll-make-sense-when-youre-older/act-four-10){:target="_blank"}.
