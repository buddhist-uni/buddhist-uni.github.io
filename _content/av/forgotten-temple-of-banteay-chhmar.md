This documentary explores the temple of Banteay Chhmar, an 800-year-old complex that was once a jewel of the Khmer Empire. Over time, it became largely forgotten except by the local people, but is now slowly being rediscovered. The film also follows the lives of a Cambodian family living near the complex, highlighting their daily lives and the role of Buddhism.
