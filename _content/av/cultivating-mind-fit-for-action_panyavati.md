> When you understand the world that you are in and you are in that place of mental fortitude, then you're not looking for anything "out there." But maybe you have something to offer people who are caught up in their fears.

In this heartfelt dhamma talk, Venerable Panyavati explains how the mind creates problems such as fear and insecurities, but once it is cultivated by the Buddhist path, it becomes peaceful and able to give peace to others.
