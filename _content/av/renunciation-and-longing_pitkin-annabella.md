Khunu Lama (1895â€“1977) was a master scholar and strict renunciant who was also a teacher to many of the twentieth century's most famous masters, including His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. In this interview about his life, Annabelle Pitkin reflects on the tension between solitude and connection in the lives of Tibetan, Buddhist monastics.
