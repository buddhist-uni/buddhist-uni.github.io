> It’s not entirely clear when Japanese women began to fear attacks by the spirits of their vengeful aborted fetuses, but it is clear that beginning in the late 1970s, women began requesting and paying for a new religious rite called *mizuko kuyō* (water child memorial) that Buddhist and Shinto priests had never heard of before.

​This podcast explores the phenomenon of *mizuko* spirit attacks in 1980s Japan, where middle and high school girls reported hauntings by the spirits of aborted fetuses. It delves into the media's role in amplifying these stories and examines the cultural and spiritual practices, such as *mizuko kuyō* rituals, that emerged to address the grief and guilt associated with abortions in Japan.​
