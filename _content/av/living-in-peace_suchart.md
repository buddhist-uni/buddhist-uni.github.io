> But one day your body’s gonna say, "No, I can no longer do it."  Your body becomes old, sick or incapacitated.  You cannot do anything.  Then, people may think about killing themselves, right?  But if you have peace from meditation, then you don’t need the body. Whatever happens to the body doesn’t bother you. You can still have peace and happiness directly. You don’t need a medium like the body and the things that the body consumes to make it happy. All you need is mindfulness to calm your mind, to stop your mind.

> But it’s not easy.  Mindfulness doesn’t come easily but it’s not impossible.  You just have to concentrate on your effort to be mindful
