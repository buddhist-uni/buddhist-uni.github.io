> The life enriched by meditation is three dimensional: it's not a completely different realm, it's providing a new and clearer perspective.

> In meditation we have this delicious, wonderful experience of being nobody... It's boring. That's the point... You can't expect to feel inspired all the time... [But] remember that all of those great monks and nuns and teachers, they all started off — every one of them — with confused minds. They weren't pure and peaceful right from the beginning. They got where they are through effort. And there's no reason why you can't put forth that same effort.

A dhamma talk at Cittarama (Malaysia) on the purpose of meditation.
