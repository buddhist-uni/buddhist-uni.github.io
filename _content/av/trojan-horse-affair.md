> A mysterious letter shocked Britain in 2014, alleging an Islamist plot to take over one cityâ€™s general schools. But who wrote it?

An eight-part miniseries in which two journalists attempt to expose an eight-year-old conspiracy in Birmingham's public schools.
The Trojan Horse Affair shows how minor racial biases and stereotypes, multiplied across society, ignited into a full-blown, moral panic
and, along the way, they uncover state secrets, an ominous cucumber, and serious questions about the role of journalism in a biased world.
