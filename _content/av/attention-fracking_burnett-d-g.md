Nevertheless, no matter how good your radar is, if the person looking at the radar screen isn't paying attention you're totally screwed.
So an intense set of classified experiments took place to assess this new problem: how long could people pay attention to screens and what could you do to optimize their ability to keep paying attention to screens for long periods of time.
