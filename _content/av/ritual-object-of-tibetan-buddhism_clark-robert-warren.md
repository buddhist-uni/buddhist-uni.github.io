The lecture explores the symbolism, function, and spiritual significance of key ritual implements used in Tibetan Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, mandalas, and offering bowls. Drawing on his expertise in Tibetan art and religious traditions, the speaker situates these objects within their ritual, doctrinal, and cultural contexts to reveal how they embody and facilitate Buddhist teachings.
