> The danger in utopian thinking is that it can easily turn you into a pointless vandal.
The more useful thing is to think of betterment as a process rather than thinking that we just have to get rid of the bad people and then everything will be okay.
If you could have enough utopianism to question the world as it is and imagine how it could be better, I think that's a wonderful thing, but if you take it too far, you actually undermine yourself.
So, I would say, a like "homeopathic utopianism" I will support.

A sweeping interview about Silicon Valley and the possible shapes of the future with the man who coined the term "virtual reality."
