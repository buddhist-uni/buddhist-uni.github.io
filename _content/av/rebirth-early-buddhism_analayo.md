In this interview, Daniel Aitken and Charles Hallisey speak with Bhikkhu Analayo about early Buddhist ideas of rebirth and Analayo's book on the topic. Some things discussed include past-life recollection, Western scientific methods in relation to rebirth, and whether a practitioner needs to believe in rebirth to attain awakening.
