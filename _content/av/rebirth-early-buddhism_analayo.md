In this interview, Daniel Aitken and [Charles Hallisey](/authors/hallisey-charles) speak with Bhikkhu Analayo about early Buddhist ideas of rebirth and Analayo's book on the topic.

They discuss: past-life recollection, Western scientific methods in relation to rebirth, and whether a practitioner needs to believe in rebirth to attain awakening.
