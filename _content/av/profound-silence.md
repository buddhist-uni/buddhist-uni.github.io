A short series of iterviews about how to make American Jodo Shinshu temples more welcoming to LGBTQ+ people (and other minorities).

Some questions to ponder and discuss after watching this video:
- Are there any minority groups that have not historically or still might not feel welcome in your community?
- What norms or behaviors contribute(d) to that?
- Are there any people you'd have a hard time "greeting with a smile" if they showed up at your temple?
