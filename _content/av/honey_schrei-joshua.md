> So when in deep, rapturous meditation, we enter the state of flow, when we are one with the present moment, this is the 'immortal nectar.'
This is why the Tibetan texts speak of *amrita* as the elixir of timeless awareness.
It's not an external liquid.
It's a byproduct of steeping in the awareness of the present moment which, when all the hormonal centers of the brain kick in, feels like being soaked in honey, basking in the nectar of the eternal 'now.'

This podcast episode explains the meaning of honey in myths from around the world by appreciating it as an apt metaphor for the experience of trance.
