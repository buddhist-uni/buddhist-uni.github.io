This 2014 talk, given at the Asian Studies Centre at Oxford University, expains the rise of Buddhist nationalist movements in Myanmar and Sri Lanka and the current state-religion relations in the two countries. It further traces the historical and contemporary connections, monastic involvement in politics, and how some Buddhists justify their attitudes and actions towards non-Buddhists.
