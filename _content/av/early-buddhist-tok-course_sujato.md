This is a five-part series on Jayatilake's "Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge"[(/content/monographs/early-buddhist-theory-of-knowledge_jayatilleke)] given by Bhante Sujato. The main topics are: 1. the historical background of non-Buddhist thought at the time of the Buddha; 2. the use and limits of logic; 3. the roles of authority and reason; and 4. the limits of knowledge.
