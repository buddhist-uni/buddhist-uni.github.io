What people enjoy about smoking is the mindfulness: taking a moment out of the day to step outside and breath.

And even the alertness of nicotine itself is [mostly caused by turning off the Default Mode Network](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5129-06.2007){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.8"}:
