This work is an annotated translation of the Yakṣa-saṃyukta as contained in an incomplete Chinese version of the Saṃyukta-āgama and is compared with its Chinese, Pali, and Sanskrit parallels. It includes a short introduction, discussions throughout, and an appendix on possible school affiliations, providing a solid study of the Yakṣa-saṃyukta. One particular point of interest is the discussion of the terms yakṣa and devatā, explaining their meaning and how they came to be viewed very similarly over time.
