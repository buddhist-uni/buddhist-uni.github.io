Beginning with tribal beliefs and cosmologies, this paper explores how views of the universe in Southeast Asia have been presented in both geographical and artistic works over time. Other ideas that are elucidated include religious syncretism, particularly Buddhist and Hindu ideas, that come to inform Southeast Asian ideas of the universe and how such syncretism is mapped.
