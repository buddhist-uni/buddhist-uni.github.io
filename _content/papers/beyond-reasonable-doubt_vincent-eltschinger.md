This paper discusses the basic epistemological views of the 6th-century Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti. The author shows how Dharmakīrti differs from Mādhyamika philosophers and shares interesting aspects with the Stoics. The paper also covers Dharmakīrti's views on perception, inference, and scriptual authority as means of valid knowledge.
