> Focusing on the shock (saṃvega) that may occur when one is reminded of things one has forgotten, the paper argues for the ethical significance not so much of remembering the past as of remembering that one has forgotten it.
> The colorful tales from the Divyāvadāna serve as brilliant and humorous reminders of the enormity of all we have forgotten.
