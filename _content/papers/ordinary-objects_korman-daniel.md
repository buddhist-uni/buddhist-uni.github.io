A detailed analysis of the existence of things, mostly from a Western perspective. The author moves through the premises, inferences, and conclusions of the conservative conception of objects and also the eliminative and permissive views, problimatizing each one. The analysis ends with a brief discussion about which objects exist fundamentally.
