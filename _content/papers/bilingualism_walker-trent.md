> The bilingual character of Theravāda Buddhism is no accident. It emerges from deliberate cultivation by Buddhist intellectuals in these regions over the past two millennia. The Theravāda transmission of texts is notably bilingual; scriptures in Pāli are often accompanied by vernacular translations and Pāli-vernacular bilingual texts, or “bitexts.”
