This book chapter examines the concept of "icons" within Theravada Buddhism, drawing on narrative depictions. It argues that debates in art history regarding insider (emic) and outsider (etic) interpretations are crucial for understanding Southeast Asian perspectives on the Buddha. These perspectives grapple with the Buddha as both a historical figure and a representation of transcendent ideals.
