> This chapter discusses a little-known Buddhist scripture, the *Sutra of the Questions by Druma, King of the Kinnara* (*Daiju kinnara-ō shomon-gyō*), translated into Chinese by Kumārajīva in the early fifth century.
> This sutra is unique in that it proposes a powerful, and sympathetic, philosophy of music rooted in the Mahayana doctrines of emptiness; it also offers a template for Buddhist rituals involving music and dance that have been performed in Japan since the eighth century as part of [the Gagaku and Bugaku repertory](/content/articles/dharma-of-music_rambelli-fabio).
