In this paper, Bhikkhu Dhammadinā thoroghly explores an early Buddhist view of epistemology, one based on the four noble truths yet grounded in personal liberative experience. Dhammadinā also explores Buddhist ideas of contact (phassa/sparśa), experiential domain (āyatana), and first-person experience.
