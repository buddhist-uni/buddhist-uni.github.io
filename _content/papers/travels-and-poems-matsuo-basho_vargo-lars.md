> Bashô was a sensitive poet whose values were firmly founded in
Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist thought. Bashô, although having seriously studied Zen, was never a monk belonging to a monastery, but he often dressed as priest and often stayed at temples and
shrines.

This chapter, from [Songs on the Road](https://uplopen.com/books/e/10.16993/bbi), explores Matsuo Bashô, the 17th-century poet and haiku originator, focusing on his travel-account Oku no hosomichi. The journey aimed to connect with nature, write poetry, and visit Buddhist temples and legends. Bashô's poems are interspersed throughout.
