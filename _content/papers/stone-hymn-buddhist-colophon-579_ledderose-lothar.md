> The first part, as is usual in votive texts, opens up a wide perspective on the Buddhist teaching and the value of sutras. It evokes the ephemeral nature of the world, including our fragile human existence. Rescue can only come through the knowledge of the correct texts that save and protect.

This book chapter details the archeological history of Stone Hymn, engraved Buddhist scriptures on Mount Tie. The chapter mentions early Chinese archiologists Huang Yi (1744–1802) and Ruan Yuan (1764–1849), as well as outlining the work done in recent years by the research group of the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften.
