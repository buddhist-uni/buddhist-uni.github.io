> True confidence only comes about once the teachings have led the disciple to personal verification of their efficacy. Monitoring the teacher and one’s own progress through direct experience here are of relevance from the initial stages of approaching a claim to truth (and one who makes it) all the way up to the conclusion of the'search' in direct realisation.

In this paper, Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā investigates Buddhist epistomolgy as a means of libertaive knowledge, using passages in the Pali version of the Saṅgārava-sutta of the Majjhima-nikāya and a Sanskrit version preserved in the Dīrgha-āgama manuscript from Gilgit. In this analysis, faith is merely a starting point.
