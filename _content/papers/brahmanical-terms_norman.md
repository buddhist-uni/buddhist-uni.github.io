>  although the Buddha took over some of the terminology of Brahmanical Hinduism,
he gave it a new Buddhist sense. The change of meaning is almost always a result of the
fact that the Brahmanical terms were used in a framework of ritualism, while the Buddha
invested them with a moral and ethical sense.
