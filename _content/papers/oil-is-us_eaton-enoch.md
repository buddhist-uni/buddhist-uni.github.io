> Residents of oil-producing communities do more 
than merely consent to the operations of industry: they actively identify 
with the oil industry and perceive their interests and the industry’s interests as one and the same.
This intense identification is manifest
in community members’ vocal defence of the industry and in their adoption of industry-propagated frames of reference for understanding wider
energy-related issues.
