> On my electric pottery wheel, a lump of freshly kneaded gray clay has already been set out for me, a gift that always makes me feel more than a little incompetent.

The wife of a Soto Zen priest writes about pottery, her Japanese community, American family, memories and loneliness in this gorgeously well-written diary of her year (mostly) apart from her beloved husband during his formal monastic training in Japan.
