> We are a huge and diverse Buddhist family following the same wise and compassionate Teacher, Śākyamuni Buddha. I believe our diversity is one of our strengths. It has allowed Buddhism to spread throughout the world and to benefit billions of people on this planet.

This introduction to the forms of Buddhism practiced today outlines with clarity and ecumenical understanding the convergences and the divergences between the two major schools--the Mahayana and the Theravāda. Especially deep consideration is given to the foundational Indian traditions and to their respective treatment of central Buddhist tenets.
