> It is the human need to express devotion to and adoration of the Buddha and his teaching that manifests itself in the act of building pagodas and in making ceremonial offerings before shrines.

This illustrated book is a journey through Burma's legendary and renowned pagodas and other famous places, sharing the myths and stories tied to each site—legends that are deeply ingrained in the hearts and minds of every Burmese.
