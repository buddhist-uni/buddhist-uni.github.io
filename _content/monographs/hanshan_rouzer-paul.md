> If you want to find a resting place,  
> Cold Mountain will keep you long.  
> A gentle breeze blows the hidden pines:  
> The closer you come, the better it sounds.  

A corpus of over three hundred poems attributed to a legendary Tang (618–907) era recluse who took the name Hánshān (Cold Mountain) from the isolated hill on which he lived in the Tiantai 天台 range.
In pre-modern times, editions of the collection usually included fifty-some poems attributed to Hanshan’s monastic companion, Shídé 拾得­ ("Foundling") and two poems attributed to another monk, Fēnggān 豐­干. 
This translation contains the complete text of the earliest surviving edition.
