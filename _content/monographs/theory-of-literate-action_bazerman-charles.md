> With the emergence of literacy as part of human cultural evolution, 
new kinds of relations and activities formed that have created structures of 
participation in larger and more distant organizations, relying on accumulating 
knowledge and mediated through genre-shaped texts. It is for these activity 
contexts that individuals must produce texts, mobilizing the resources of 
language, and it is within these contexts that the texts will have their effect.

This second, companion volume to [*A Rhetoric of Literate Action*](/content/monographs/rhetoric-of-literate-action_bazerman-charles) supplies the theoretical understanding of what written language is and does which underlies that volume's practical advice.
But far from being a mere appendix, this survey of psycho-social theories of media and culture serves well as a compelling introduction to the theory of language in general and its place in society.
