> Wonhyo examined the broad range of Mahāyāna doctrines in a systematic,
rational, thoroughgoing, and insightful manner. In addition to the breadth of
his scholarly mastery of the Mahāyāna system, he possessed excellent skills in
literary Chinese, and the combination of these talents allowed his writings to
bring a profound influence on the development of Buddhism in East Asia.

This volume brings together key writings and prefaces of Wonhyo that present his integrative approach to Mahāyāna Buddhism—systematising multiple doctrinal strands into a unified framework and emphasising the harmonisation of apparent conflicts.
