> The future holds daunting challenges for human society and our environment.
Populations are expanding, demand for resources is increasing, the climate is changing, and humanity’s impacts on the planet continue to mount.
Will we be able to achieve a better quality of life for our growing population without compromising the ability of future generations to achieve the same?

> By refocusing and redoubling its efforts to advance practical, impactful solutions for humanity’s multifaceted, vexing problems, the field of environmental engineering can build on its past successes—and chart new territory—in the decades ahead.
