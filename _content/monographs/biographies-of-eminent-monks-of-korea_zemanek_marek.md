> The harmony between the master and the disciple
was as fortunate as a mustard seed falling from the sky hitting the point
of a needle.

This work offers English readers a threefold insight into Korean Buddhist hagiography by presenting three major compilations of biographies of eminent monks. The translations and annotations were based on an annotated Korean manuscript, with reference to the Hanmun originals held at the Archives of Buddhist Culture at Dongguk University.
