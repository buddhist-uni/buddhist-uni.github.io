> The Great Way is not difficult  
for those who have no preferences.  
When love and hate are both absent  
everything becomes clear and undisguised.  
Make the smallest distinction, however,  
and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.

An approachable and clear commentary on this famous, Chinese poem explaining how Chan can be understood as a merging of Taoism with Buddhism.
