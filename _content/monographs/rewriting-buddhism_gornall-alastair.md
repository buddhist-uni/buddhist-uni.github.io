In this monograph, scholar Alastair Gornall presents his case that the productivity of pre-modern Sri Lanka was not due to political stability but rather to the social, economic, and political chaos brought about by invasions and civil wars. Gornall shows that these reforms led to new forms of Pali literature, which, in turn, preserved the Buddhist tradition and expanded it to elite circles.
