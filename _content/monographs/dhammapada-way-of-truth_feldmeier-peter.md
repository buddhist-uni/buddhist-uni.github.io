> If we were to isolate and analyze each verse in the
Dhammapada by itself, we would miss a great deal, for
each verse draws much meaning from a larger context.

his 2013 translation of the Dhammapada by Peter Feldmeier offers a fresh perspective on the text. In addition to presenting a new translation of each verse, Feldmeier provides his own interpretations, placing each verse within the broader context of Theravada Buddhism.
