> With the present book I return to the Pāli version of the
Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta. My exploration is entirely dedicated to the
actual practice of satipaṭṭhāna, informed by the previously
gathered details and overall picture as it emerges from a
study of relevant material in the early discourses.

Building on his early work, Bhikkhu Analayo details a mindfulness practise that incorporates all aspects of Buddhist psychology.
