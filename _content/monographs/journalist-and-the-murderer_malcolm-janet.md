> For, of course, at bottom, no subject is naïve.
> Every hoodwinked widow, every deceived lover, every betrayed friend, every subject of writing knows on some level what is in store for him, and remains  in the relationship anyway, impelled by something stronger than his reason.

> Something seems to happen to people when they meet a journalist, and what happens is exactly the opposite of what one would expect. One would think that extreme wariness and caution would be the order of the day, but in fact childish trust and impetuosity are far more common.
> The journalistic encounter seems to have the same regressive effect on a subject as the psychoanalytic encounter. The subject becomes a kind of child of the writer, regarding him as a permissive, all-accepting, all-forgiving mother, and expecting that the book will be written by her. Of course, the book is written by the strict, all-noticing, unforgiving father.

> If everybody  put his cards on the table, the game would be over. The journalist must do his work in a kind of deliberately induced state of moral anarchy.

> The moral ambiguity of journalism lies not in its texts but in the relationships out of which they arise—relationships that are invariably and inescapably lopsided.

A unique lawsuit against a murderer's "best friend" (the journalist) lays bare the deception at the heart of the journalistic encounter.
