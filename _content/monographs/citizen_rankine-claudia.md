> Perhaps this is how racism feels no matter the context--randomly the rules everyone else gets to play by no longer apply to you, and to call this out by calling out "I swear to God!" is to be called insane, crass, crazy. Bad sportsmanship.

An astonishingly good book of poetry describing the contemporary African American experience and how "race" emerges in relation.
