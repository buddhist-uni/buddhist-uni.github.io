> Power allows the ego to be with him- or herself in the other. It creates a continuity of the self.

An exploration of power reacting to a few modern philosophers on the subject.

I found the work engaging and impressive, despite its odd avoidance of the psychological. As a Buddhist, I can't agree that "life as such cannot be understood in terms of causal relations," though I appreciate the book, insofar as it advocates and "leads to [...] an ethics and aesthetics of the *no one*: *friendliness* free of intentions, even free of *wishes*."
