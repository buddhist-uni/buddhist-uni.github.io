The best translation in English of the most important collection of the Buddha's discourses, with a lengthy introduction, sutta summaries, and helpful endnotes summarizing important commentarial points, this book is a must have for any student of Buddhism.

About a third of the suttas have been made available for free by the publisher and have been collected into [this open source booklet]({% link _content/booklets/mn-selections_nyanamoli-bodhi.md %}) for your consideration, however the full book is preferred and well worth the investment.
