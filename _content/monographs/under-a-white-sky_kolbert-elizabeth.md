> a book about people trying to solve problems created by people trying to solve problems

A few case studies of mankind setting out to fix his environment. 

By zooming in on tiny fish and out to the entire stratosphere, it beautifully captures the staggering scope of climate change and its challenges. In highlighting the scientists and engineers working on it, the book offers a somewhat more realistic picture of our future as less apocalyptic and more incredibly strange.

The book also makes a strong case for being sceptical that we can engineer our way out of climate change, and nods to the "but what other choice do we have" counterargument. I hope that readers come away from this dramatic tension more convinced than ever of the need for rapid decarbonization and that they don't leap to even worse ideas than those covered here, such as [everybody's favorite bad idea: population control](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/26/16356524/the-population-question).
