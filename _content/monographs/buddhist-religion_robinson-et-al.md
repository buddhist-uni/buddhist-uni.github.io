I cannot recommend this classic textbook on the history of Buddhism highly enough. Short and readable, yet thorough and precise, this must-read covers the entire history of Buddhism in a couple hundred lively pages.

I have referenced the fourth edition on this site, but the newest available version should be preferred.
