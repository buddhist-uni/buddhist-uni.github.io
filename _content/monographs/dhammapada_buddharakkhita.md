A classic translation of this classic book of poetry from the PƒÅli Canon.

This particular translation has had an enormous impact on the English language scholarship, being the first reliable and elegant translation of the book in the tradition. Most translations since (and there have been many!) have followed Venerable Buddharakkhita's impeccable reading.
