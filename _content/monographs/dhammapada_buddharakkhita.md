A classic translation of the primary book of poetry from the Pāli Canon.

This translation had a large impact on Pāli scholarship, being the first reliable and beautiful translation of the book in English. Every translation since (and there have been many!) is deeply indebted to Venerable Buddharakkhita's thoughtful rendering, now available for free through the generosity of the BPS.
