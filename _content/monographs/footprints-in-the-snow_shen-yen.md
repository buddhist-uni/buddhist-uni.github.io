> I have seen much death in my lifetime--war, famine, disease. I am at the end of my life now. One day soon I will die. The lesson of the flood is still with me. I know that there is no use worrying about death. The important thing is to live fully until the moment when it comes.

A modern Zen master tells his story of hardship and diaspora, showing how Buddhism moved from China to Taiwan and, eventually, the West.
