An excellent textbook for doing what the title says.

I especially appreciate the book's organization: the chapters are arranged as the tradition often explains itself and each chapter is further subdivided into short sections, making it easy to pick and choose from or to reference later.
Each chapter ends with reflection questions and pointers to additional reading, making this a perfect teaching resource.
