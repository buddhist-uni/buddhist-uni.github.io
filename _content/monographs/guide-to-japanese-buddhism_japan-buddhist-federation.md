brought about the Kamakura period (1192–1333). The increasing dis-
cord and chaos of the times led to disillusionment and a call for
the revival of faith. It was during these troubled time that Hōnen
(1133–1212), Shinran (1173–1262), Eisai (1141–1215), Dōgen (1200–1253),
Nichiren (1222–1282), and other Buddhist leaders appeared and
expounded their teachings of salvation for all.

A concise history of Buddhism in Japan, tracing its development from its arrival to the present day. The work also explores the relationship between Japanese daily life and Buddhist rituals. It concludes with a hopeful message of fostering world peace through an understanding of oneness.
