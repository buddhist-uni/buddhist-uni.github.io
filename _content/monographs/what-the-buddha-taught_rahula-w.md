The classic introduction to Buddhist philosophy to the modern reader.

Walpola Rahula's book has had a dramatic impact on the shape of Buddhist thought in the West but its interest is far from merely historical: it remains one of the most lucid and sympathetic introductions available in English, even today. Highly recommended for newcomers to Buddhism or anyone looking for a solid grounding in Buddhist doctrine.
