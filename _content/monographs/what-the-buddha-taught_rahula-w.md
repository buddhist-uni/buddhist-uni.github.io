The classic introduction to Buddhist philosophy to the modern reader.

Walpola Rahula's book has had a dramatic impact on the shape of Buddhist thought in the West but its interest is far from merely historical: it remains one of the most lucid and sympathetic introductions available in English, even today. Recommended for newcomers to Buddhism or anyone looking for a solid grounding in Buddhist doctrine.

You can also find the book read out loud [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sl3jKFTKkuI){:ga-event-value="1"},
