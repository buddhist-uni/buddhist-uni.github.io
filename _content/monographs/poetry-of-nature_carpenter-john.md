Based on [the 2018 exhibition at The Met of the same name](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/poetry-of-nature), this beautiful volume explains how different strands of Japanese culture, from literature to Buddhism to theater, came together in the calligraphy-laden nature paintings of 17th, 18th and early 19th century Japan.
