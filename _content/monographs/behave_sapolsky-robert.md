> If we accept that there will always be sides, it’s a nontrivial to-do list item to always be on the side of angels. Distrust essentialism. Keep in mind that what seems like rationality is often just rationalization, playing catch-up with subterranean forces that we never suspect. Focus on the larger, shared goals. Practice perspective taking. Individuate, individuate, individuate. [...] You don’t have to choose between being scientific and being compassionate.

A magisterial and heart-felt survey of neuroscience, psychology, and biology which paints a broad but rigorous picture of how and why humans act the way they do--for better or for worse--and what we (individual meatbags) can do to be our best selves.

The book is based on Sapolsky's Stanford course, ["Human Behavioral Biology", available on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D){:ga-event-value="3"}.
