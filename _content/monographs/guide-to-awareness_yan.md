> Our cultivation of the mind is aimed both at firmly establishing
calm and at developing the arising of true wisdom and insight. We
depend on the practice as laid down by the Lord Buddha which I have
been explaining in stages.

In this brief work, Somdet Phra Nyanasamvara illuminates the principles of mindfulness within the larger framework of mental cultivation. Each section is taken from various talks given between August and October 1961 to both monastics and laypeople, in which the venerable offers practical instruction for cultivating clarity, calm, and insight.
