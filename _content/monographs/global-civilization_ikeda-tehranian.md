> A global civilization is in the process of formation.
This book is the result of that kind of fermentation.
It focuses on the spiritual and ethical foundations and contours of such a civilization when and if genuine global dialogue is pursued.
It has taken us eight years, frequent meetings, and continuous correspondence to arrive at this point.
We share it with you, dear reader, in the belief that something is to be gained by learning that human experience and ideas are inevitably varied around the world, but when two persons of good will enter into a sincere conversation about their own truths, a more universal truth emerges.
