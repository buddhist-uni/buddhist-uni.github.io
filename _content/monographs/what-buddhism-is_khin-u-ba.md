> Purity of mind is the greatest common denomiator of all religions. Love, which alone is the means for the unity of mankind, must be supreme, and it cannot be so unless the mind is transcendentally pure.

This book contains the transcriptions of a series of three lectures given in 1951 by Sayagyi U Ba Khin. The lectures were given at the request of a religious study group in Burma and contain a summary of the life and teachings of the Buddha as found in the Theravada tradition.
