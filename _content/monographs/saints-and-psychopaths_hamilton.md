> Psychopaths are more likely to be attracted to singing, dancing, love, light, miracles, and channeling. Usually psychopaths have a great deal of trouble sitting quiet and still. I appreciate the boring facade of Buddhism, as it is a great protection.

A new age mystic gives his advice on how to identify psychopaths on the spiritual journey.

Despite Bill's many painful experiences, he never lost his faith in the transformative, human potential to awaken. His lifetime of spiritual stumbling is a rich source of warnings and advice, especially for Westerners still struggling to get a foothold in a tradition.

That said, however, the book's interpretation of "enlightenment" should be taken cautiously, as his understanding seems to come from ecumenical assumptions that the various "contemplative traditions" (never defined) all describe the same goal. A bit of a black sheep even within the heterodox, secular "Insight"  community, Bill Hamilton is best read with his own warning in mind, that "monks and nuns make safer teachers than laypeople, especially if they are actively associated with their tradition."
