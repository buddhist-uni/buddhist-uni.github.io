A modern classic of contemporary, Western ethics, Peter Singer persuasively argues that people with disposable income (and that probably includes you) should give more to the world's poorest people. After all, which is more important: saving a life or buying another pair of shoes?

Nearly incontrovertible in its conclusion, the book inspired a revolution in charity in the West and encouraged many (me included) to donate  more to charity than they ever had before.

The tenth anniversary edition is available for free online.
