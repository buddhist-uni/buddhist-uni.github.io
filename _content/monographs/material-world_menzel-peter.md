Traveling around the globe and living for a week with average families from a variety of countries, sixteen photographers collaborated with thirty families to make this revealing series of portraits.

An acclaimed meditation on our material existence, some of the photos from this book can be previewed on [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/04/08/material-world-peter-menzel/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}, [Menzel's Website](http://menzelphoto.com/galleries/material-world/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.3"} or on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yw6VtYB8MTF4BuhOm_6laYPNyx9ZSrpu/view?usp=drivesdk){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="1"}.
