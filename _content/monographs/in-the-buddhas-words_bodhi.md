In this contemporary anthology of the Buddha's teachings, Bhikkhu Bodhi organizes the key content of the suttas into a logical and progressive series of ten chapters.

An open-source version can be read online for free at [Reading Faithfully](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/in-the-buddhas-words-an-anthology-of-discourses-from-the-pali-canon-linked-to-suttacentral-net/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.75"} or via the [links compiled online](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/in-the-buddha-s-words/29?u=khemarato.bhikkhu), but the real book is still recommended for its helpful redactions and notes.
