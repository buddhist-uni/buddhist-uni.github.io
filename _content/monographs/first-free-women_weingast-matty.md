> If youâ€™re going to tell yourself a story,

A deeply American meditation on (**not** translation of!) the *Therigatha*.

Read this book critically, alongside [a real translation](https://readingfaithfully.org/tag/therigatha/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"}, so that you can see for yourself how the poems changed the originals. Consider what was lost, what was added, and how the tone shifted.
