> "Anthropocene" is the proposed name for a geologic epoch in which humans have become the major force determining the continuing livability of the earth. The word tells a big story: living arrangements that took millions of years to put into place are being undone in the blink of an eye. The hubris of conquerors and corporations makes it uncertain what we can bequeath to our next generations, human and not human. The enormity of our dilemma leaves scientists, writers, artists, and scholars in shock. How can we best use our research to stem the tide of ruination?

A gorgeous pair of edited volumes collecting papers and artwork grappling with the enormity of climate change. Better suited to the coffee-table than the night-stand, these hefty volumes contain not a single, pat message but a plurality of engagements from different corners of our fragile, blue spaceship.
