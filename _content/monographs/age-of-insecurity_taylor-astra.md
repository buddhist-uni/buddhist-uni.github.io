> ... because Cura first fashioned the being, let her possess it as long as it lives.

> This existential insecurity is the kind that comes from being dependent on others for survival; from being vulnerable to physical and psychological illness or wounding; and, of course, from being mortal.
It’s the insecurity of randomness and risk, of a future that is impossible to control or to know.
It is a kind of insecurity we can never wholly escape or armour ourselves against, try as we might to mitigate potential harms.

> Yet however unknowable the future may be, there is no doubt our fortunes will remain interlinked.
Risks proliferate, time passes, and things fall apart.
But even amid the rubble, we can always reimagine, repair, and rebuild.
Accepting our fundamental insecurity—the gift we all share—is the first step toward escaping our fear-filled burrows and ensuring our collective freedom, safety, and well-being.
