> Once a person understands the rise and fall of all
phenomena, then experiencing the worst that human
life can give does not make one tremble.

Ajahn Brahm explains the meaning of emptiness, or nothingness, as he puts it, as the self-less and impermenant nature of all phenomena. After this detailed explanation, the Ajahn points out that not realizing this emptiness causes most people's suffering; therefore, one should strive "to still the mind and see the most beautiful jewel there could ever beâ€”nothingness."
