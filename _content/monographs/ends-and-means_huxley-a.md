> Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient means for going backwards.

A classic collection of essays on the relationship between ideas and society which draws heavily on Huxley's engagements with Buddhist philosophy. 

The product of a bygone era, *Ends and Means* diagnoses modernity without the despair or self-promotion characteristic of later engagements. One instead feels the vitality and honesty that animated Huxley's life and continue to inspire readers nearly a century later.
