> Creating mutual understanding
among religions – is necessary because the world must
have many religions, as many as the types of people in
the world, in order for all to be able to live together
in peace. Every religion teaches unselfishness, the
differences are merely in methodologies.

For his 80th birthday, known as his ‘Age Teasing Day,’ Tan Ajahn (Buddhadāsa) prepared a souvenir book for his students, featuring Dhamma photos, proverbs, sayings, riddles, and legacies. One section included a concise summary of his teachings, progressing from practical matters to abstract and spiritual legacies, which are presented in this volume.
