> Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.

A foundational classic in the field of product design, you will never look at any _thing_ the same way again.

And if you loved this book, which I know you will, I also highly recommend its sequel: _Emotional Design_ published by Basic in 2003.
