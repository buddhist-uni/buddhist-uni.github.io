> I am like a tree in a forest, full of leaves, blossoms and fruit. Birds come
to eat and nest, and animals seek rest in its shade. Yet the tree does
not know itself. It follows its own nature. It is as it is.

This enriching collection features Ajahn Chah's most well-known similes, divided into two parts. Part I includes the 75 similes from the first volume of the bilingual edition of A Tree in a Forest, while Part II contains the 108 similes from the second volume.
