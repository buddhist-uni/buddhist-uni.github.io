> Therefore it is very important to learn to shape the mind, and when you learn to shape the mind then you can
achieve a mind that is free. So the importance of meditation is learning to achieve a mind
that is free, a mind that is happy, a mind that is peaceful, a mind that has loving-kindness.

This is a representation of Goodwin Samararatne's talks given in Hong Kong in 1997.

In these talks, Samararatne explains a variety of topics related to meditation on loving-kindness and mindfulness, especially in daily life.
