> The shift from hunting-gathering to farming began only about 11,000 years ago; the first metal tools were produced only about 7,000 years ago; and the first state government and the first writing arose only around 5,400 years ago. "Modern" conditions have prevailed, even just locally, for only a tiny fraction of human history

Paints a vivid picture of what traditional life was like (is still like in some places) in prehistoric human societies and contrasts this with how most humans (especially in the West) live today. Jared Diamond himself lived this way for some time and brings a unique and earnest voice to the subject which I found affective and memorable.
