> The shift from hunting-gathering to farming began only about 11,000 years ago; the first metal tools were produced only about 7,000 years ago; and the first state government and the first writing arose only around 5,400 years ago. "Modern" conditions have prevailed, even just locally, for only a tiny fraction of human history

In many ways the prequel to [*Sapiens*]({% link _content/monographs/sapiens_harari-y.md %}), this book paints a vivid picture of what traditional life was like (is still like in some places) in prehistoric human societies and contrasts this with how most humans (especially in the West) live today. Jared Diamond himself lived like this for some time and so brings a unique and earnest voice to the subject which I personally found affective and memorable.
