> I, Li Bo, love wine completely, right now. How to attain the immortality within wine? This Dao always gets muddled. Donâ€™t look for it in a ladle! The deity of drunkenness will give transmission to whoever is chosen.

An anthology of writing by and about the legendary swashbuckler-poet of Tang China.
