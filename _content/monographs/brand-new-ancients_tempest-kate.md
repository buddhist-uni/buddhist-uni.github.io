> We must stay hopeful;  
We must stay patient –  
because when they excavate the modern day  
they’ll find us: the Brand New Ancients

An epic poem about inglorious Brits, a morality tale with a potty mouth, and a crafty myth without artifice, Brand New Ancients attempts to tell the story of human life through a series of interwoven vignettes.
