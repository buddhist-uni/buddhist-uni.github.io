> The ability to believe is the seed out of which all wholesome things develop; this is the first prerequisite for the harvest of arahantship. Just as the farmer brings seeds along and sows them in the field trusting that they will sprout and bear fruit, so the monk sows the seeds of wholesomeness trusting that they will sprout into serenity and insight and will eventually bear the fruit of NibbƒÅna.

A thorough introduction to the similes of the early Canon, Hecker retells 85 similes and then gives a  commentary on each.
