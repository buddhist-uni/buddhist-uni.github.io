The classic introduction to Buddhist meditation.

The book was written in 1990, and Wisdom published an expanded version in 1991 that became a huge success. That version has since undergone several revisions and reprints, the latest being the "20th Anniversary Edition" from 2011.

[A shorter version of this book from the 1970s (called *Come and See*)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrycSEC2G0g755ApbtnpaPGw3tyIauVA/view?usp=drivesdk) is available over at [the Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation](https://www.budaedu.org/books/5353).
