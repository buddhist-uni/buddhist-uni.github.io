The classic introduction to Buddhist meditation.

Written in 1990, Wisdom published an expanded version in 1991 that became a huge success. That version has itself now undergone several revisions and reprints, the latest being the "20th Anniversary Edition" from 2011.

An older edition of the book  can be ordered in physical form **for free** by contacting [the Corporate Body of the Buddha Educational Foundation](https://www-old.budaedu.org/en/book/).
