The classic introduction to Buddhist meditation.

Written in 1990, Wisdom published an expanded version in 1991 that became a huge success. That version has itself now undergone several revisions and reprints, the latest being the "20th Anniversary Edition" from 2011 which is the version I recommend.

If you prefer to not spend money, the original manuscript can still be found [online here](https://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english.php){:target="_blank"} for free.
