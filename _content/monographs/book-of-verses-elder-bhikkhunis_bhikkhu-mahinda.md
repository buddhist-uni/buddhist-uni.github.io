This is a translation of the Therīgāthāpāli, found in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pāli Canon. Also called the Book of Verses of the Edler Bhikkunis, it is a collection of approximately 524 verses attributed to 73 senior nuns who lived during the Buddha’s time, with a few from slightly later periods. These verses express the joy of spiritual attainments and of gratitude and also contain praises of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha. The Therīgāthā is one of the earliest spiritual texts that exclusively records the voices of women.
