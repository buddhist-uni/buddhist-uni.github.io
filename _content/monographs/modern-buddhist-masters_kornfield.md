> teachings from twelve of the greatest masters and monasteries in the Theravada tradition

This classic book on insight meditation introduced the West to the Theravada Tradition of Southeast Asia and launched the career of not only its author, but also many of his readers who subsequently sought out, learned from, and carried on the tradition of these venerable masters. 

It's basically impossible to understand modern Theravada Buddhism without being familiar with at least most of the teachers featured in this outstanding book, but its value isn't strictly historical as the wisdom and advice it contains is invaluable not just to scholars but also to any serious meditator intent on realizing the fruits of insight practice.
