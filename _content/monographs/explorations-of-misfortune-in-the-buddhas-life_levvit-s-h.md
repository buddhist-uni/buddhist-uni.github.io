This monograph translates the Pali and Sinhala work "Detiskarma Pardarthayi," which is a version of the original Pali text Pubbakammapiloti, a chapter of the Apadāna. The text deals with the human past lives of the Buddha, specifically focusing on his misdeeds. It appears to attempt an explanation for why the Buddha experienced suffering in his last life. None of the stories in this text are present in the Jātaka.
