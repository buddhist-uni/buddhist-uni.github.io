> What do we expect when we say something to someone, and what do they expect when they hear it? When is a conversation successful? The book considers a wide set of two-person conversations, and a bit of game theory, to show how conversational statements and their interpretations are governed by beliefs.


> The book describes the theoretical framework and empirical measurements of misunderstandings—written by an economist, but in simple words and using interdisciplinary concepts.
