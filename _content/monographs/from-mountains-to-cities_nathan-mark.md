> Notwithstanding
the long history of Buddhism in the peninsula, it was far from certain at the 
dawn of the twentieth century that the tradition would be able to secure a
viable and legitimate place in modern Korean society.
This book argues that a key factor in the effort to revitalize the
religion was the concerted and sustained attempt
by a wide variety of Buddhist organizations and individuals to systematically propagate (*p’ogyo* 布敎) Buddhism.
