> To examine whether mental representations of facial expressions of physical pain and sexual pleasure (i.e., orgasm) are distinguishable or not, we modeled these representations in individuals from two cultures (Western and East Asian; Methods,Observers).

The study shows that pleasure has a distinct facial expression across cultures, while evidence for a uniquely identifiable pain expression remains equivocal.
