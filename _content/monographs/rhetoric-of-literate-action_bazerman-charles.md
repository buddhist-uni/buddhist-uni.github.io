> The first four chapters of this volume provide 
a framework for identifying and understanding the situations writing comes 
out of and is directed toward. The next four chapters then consider how a text 
works to transform a situation and achieve the writer’s motives as the text begins 
to take form. The final four chapters provide more specific advice of the work 
to be accomplished in bringing the text to final form and how to manage the 
work and one’s own emotions and energies so as to accomplish the work most
effectively. 
The advice of this book is for the experienced writer with a substantial 
repertoire of skills, who now would find it useful to think in more fundamental 
strategic terms about what they want their texts to accomplish, what form the 
texts might take, how to develop specific contents, and how to arrange the work 
of writing.
