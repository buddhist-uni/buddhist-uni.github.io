> Ledi Sayadaw was simultaneously a great teacher to his monks and lay disciples, a great Dhamma preacher to large segments of the Burmese population, a founder and organizer of many Buddhist lay organizations, a famous teacher and popularizer of meditation practice, especially Ānāpāna and Vipassanā, and a classical scholar-monk and author of classical work.

Born in 1846, known for his deep meditation practice and devotion to the Abhidhamma, Ledi Sayadaw played a pivotal role in the revival of Theravāda Buddhism in Burma and beyond.
