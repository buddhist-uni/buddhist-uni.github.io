> The Abhidhamma is not for those timid souls who are not content that
a philosophical thought should not actually contradict Buddhist
tradition, but demand that it must be expressly, even literally,
supported by canonical or commentarial authority. Such an
attitude is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the BuddhaDhamma.

In this collection of essays, Venerable Nyanaponika Thera makes the complex principles and methods of the Abhidhamma accessible, focusing on Dhammasangani. He delves into the nature of consciousness, time, and the psychology of spiritual development. The book highlights the ongoing relevance of Buddhist thought for contemporary philosophical and psychological inquiry.
