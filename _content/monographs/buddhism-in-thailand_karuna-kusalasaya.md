This work explores the history of Buddhism in Thailand, beginning with an overview of four major traditions: Theravāda, Mahāyāna, Burmese, and Sri Lankan. It then examines the state of Buddhism in Thailand as of the mid-20th century, with a particular focus on the Sangha, as well as the roles of involvement in its organization and functions.
