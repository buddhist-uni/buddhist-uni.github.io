An anthology of "teachings given by women who were direct disciples of the Buddha" compiled from the Pāli Canon and its northern parallels.

Not to be confused with [the 1988 Snow Lion book about Sakyadhītā](https://archive.org/details/sakyadhitadaught0000unse/page/n1/mode/1up) nor [the 2015 book about contemporary nuns](/content/monographs/buddhas-daughters_toomey-christine) which both share a similar title.
