> Please, O Lord, may all the boons  
for which I fervently pray  
come true at once and come to be  
from now until nirvana’s time!

> … highlights of the Cambodian Dharma song tradition.
> Many of the most popular songs are included, along with others of exceptional interest or literary merit. All of the major themes of the genre are covered: the life of the Buddha, gratitude to parents, the impermanence of the body, and [the] aspiration for nirvana.

Listen to an interview with the author [on the New Books Network](/content/av/until-nirvanas-time_walker-trent) or hear him perform a few of the songs from this book [on Shambhala's website](https://www.shambhala.com/songs-from-until-nirvanas-time/).
And for the author's previous translations and performances, see his open-access album [“Stirring and Stilling” (2011)](/content/av/stirring-stilling_walker-trent).

The book also contains a number of original essays on the history of Cambodian Buddhism and its poetry, alongside a thorough bibliography for the author's sources.
