> Eissler may have been attracted to Jeff in somewhat the way Freud was attracted to Fliess.
Fliess was a very charming and vivacious man, and Freud had a need and a terrible weakness for that kind of glamorous person.
When Jung came along, he became that person again for Freud.
Both Fliess and Jung were charlatans in some ways, but very bright, very beguiling ones.
There must have been something of that sort going on between Eissler and Jeff.

A "charming charlatan" weasels his way into the Sigmund Freud Archives and discovers shocking letters the family had been hiding for decades.
