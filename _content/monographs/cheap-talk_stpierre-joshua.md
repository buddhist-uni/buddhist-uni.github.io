> The production of cheap talk relies everywhere on the depoliticisation of communication. Cheap talk displaces a shared traversal of difference with a technocratic exchange of messages. [...] This is a thoroughly sterile ecology of communication: minds making speech to transfer information to other minds. [...] It is not dysfluency but fluency that ensnares life with a type of deathly repetition.

> There are political and existential questions at stake that are difficult even to articulate within a surge of cheap talk: What might a dysfluent event become if not immediately managed? How might we relate differently? What might we become?
