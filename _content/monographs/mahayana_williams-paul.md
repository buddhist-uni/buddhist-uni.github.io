The authoritative, scholarly introduction to Mahayana Buddhism's vast textual history.

In explaining the nearly impossible diversity of Mahayana texts, the book strikes an admirable balance between respect and skepticism, sticking mostly to the established historical facts. The reader is left to draw her own conclusions about the merits or demerits of the texts themselves.
