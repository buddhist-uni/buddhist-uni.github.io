> Experiencing autonomy—being allowed to make those choices that constitute an autonomous life—as a learner is a better way of learning to be autonomous than being told what to do.

> Education of whatever type cannot be sustained without some notion of imparting a belief system.

> What I have been doing here is positioning knowledge acquisition and retention as pre-eminent dispositions of human beings and thus giving a privileged position to epistemology in the scheme of things.
> And what this means is that other human attributes and activities such as learning, ethics, or ways of behaving supervene on knowledge: [and] the form that learning can assume depends on the epistemology that is adopted.

> This valuing goes all the way down, into our descriptions of the world, into those attempts we make at creating better futures and into our relations with other people.
