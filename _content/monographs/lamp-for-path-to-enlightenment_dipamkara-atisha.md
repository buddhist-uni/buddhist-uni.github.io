Supreme enlightenment

Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, written by Atisha Dipamkara, is a key text in the Kadampa tradition and respected across all Tibetan Buddhist lineages. It provides a concise outline of the full Buddhist path, covering both sutra and tantra. This edition includes a new translation along with a commentary by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thaye, which presents the main points in a clear and practical manner.
