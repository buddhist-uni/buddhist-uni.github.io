> The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite. [...] May the House in its Beauty shelter us both.

A man imprisoned in The Labyrinth of Forgotten Things makes sense of his new/old/perpetual Home.

The novel resists a simple, allegorical reading, but instead hums with symbolism and irony as it dances around its heady themes.
While intellectuals will enjoy turning those over, ultimately it is Piranesi's sincerity and emotional strength that ensure the book won't soon be Forgotten.
