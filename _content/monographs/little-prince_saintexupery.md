> And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.

A much-beloved, short, poetic story (nominally for children) which captures poignantly the existential crisis of growing up in the modern world, and encourages us all to not lose touch with that simple, direct wisdom of our inner child.
