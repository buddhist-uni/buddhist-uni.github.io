> Given the growing dilution of Buddhist identity and its 
tendency toward syncretism in Brazil, this paper works with the heuristic concept of a 
'Buddhism in Syncretic Shape.' Since this concept is useful for better understanding some 
groups in Brazil, it is suggested that it can also provide interesting insights for the study of 
Buddhism in the West. This concept will be developed through a detailed description of 
Shingon in Brazil, which has undergone a religious synthesis with Catholicism and Afro-Brazilian religions.
