> It has been claimed that Indian Buddhism, as opposed to East Asian Chan/Zen traditions, was somehow against humour.
> In this paper I contend that humour is discernible in canonical Indian Buddhist texts, particularly in Indian Buddhist monastic law codes (Vinaya).
> I will attempt to establish that what we find in these texts sometimes is not only humourous but that it is intentionally so.
