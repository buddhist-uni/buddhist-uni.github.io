> In five experiments, participants (n = 701) were shown two silhouettes of bodies alongside emotional words, stories, movies, or facial expressions.
> They were asked to color the bodily regions whose activity they felt increasing or decreasing while viewing each stimulus.
> Different emotions were consistently associated with statistically separable bodily sensation maps across experiments.
> These maps were concordant across West European and East Asian samples.

> Perception of these emotion-triggered bodily changes may play a key role in generating consciously felt emotions.
