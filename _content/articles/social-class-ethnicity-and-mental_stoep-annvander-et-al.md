> This paper revisits a landmark study of the prevalence of mental illness in the state of Massachusetts conducted by Edward Jarvis in the 19th century.
> Jarvis drew an improper conclusion about the relationship between social class, ethnicity, and insanity, asserting that the Irish foreign-born had a higher prevalence of insanity in each social stratum.
> A reanalysis of Jarvis' data shows that in both the pauper and independent social classes in Massachusetts, the prevalence of insanity was significantly _lower_ among foreign-born persons than among native-born persons.

> On the basis of his misperception, Jarvis constructed elaborate etiological theories.
> These theories made a strong impact on the mental health service policies of his day.
> The effects of incomplete examination of data on etiological theories and mental health policy in current times are highlighted in this article.
