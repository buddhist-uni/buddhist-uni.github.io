In this short story, the author explores the author's personal experience with mindfulness and walking meditation during the annual procession in Kandy. Through the perspective of an elephant, the narrative reflects on the challenges of staying mindful and the impact of ego and attachment, drawing a comparison between the physical act of walking and the deeper lessons of inner peace and letting go of suffering. The author also recounts past memories, including moments of attachment, disappointment, and the eventual realization of the transient nature of these emotions.
