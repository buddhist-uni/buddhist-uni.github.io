> Embarrassed the organizers were indeed, even dismayed, when they were showered with fervent thanks from the women participants for organizing such a wonderful spiritual experience...

> This article discusses the modern reenactments of the Nunohashi kanjoe (the Cloth-Bridge Consecration [Initiation] rite) in Tateyama-cho, Toyama prefecture, and the religious and political issues they raised.
> Originally a popular Edo-period rite for women's salvation, the Nunohashi kanjoe was obsolete for one hundred and thirty years, until it was reconstructed and performed as the main spectacle of the Culture Festival ibento (event) in Tateyama in 1996.
> A decade later, in 2005, 2006, and 2009, its reenactments were resumed as ceremonies of traditional healing.
> This paper follows the progression of these attempts at transforming a Buddhist ritual into a modern-day cultural event.
> It looks at the gap between the politics and purposes behind the reenactments of the rites, and the reactions of the women who participated in them.
> It further considers general issues illuminated by these reenactments, such as the nature and status of religious experiences, and the relations of religion and state in contemporary Japan.
