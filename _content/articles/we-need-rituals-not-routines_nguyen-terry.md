> Rituals can be an artistic process, a meditation, a communal celebration, or a simple act of
observation, according to Kate Southworth, a London-based artist whose works are rooted in ritual.
“Rituals often have an intention,” Southworth said. “I think the framing of that intention to be as
important as its enactment.” It’s a form of resistance, she added, “to let go of the rational mind of
habit and routine.”

The article shows that rituals—unlike productivity-driven routines—help people instill a sense of calm and sustain mindfulness by imbuing ordinary actions with intention and meaning. In this way, rituals can stabilize life and foster connection in an otherwise distracted, fast-paced world.
