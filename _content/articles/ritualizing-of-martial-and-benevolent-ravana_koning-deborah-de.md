> Within the context of Ravanisation—by which I mean the current revitalisation of Ravana among Sinhalese Buddhists in Sri Lanka—multiple conceptualizations of Ravana are constructed.
> This article concentrates on two different Ravana conceptualizations: Ravana as a warrior king and Ravana as a healer.

> At the Sri Devram Maha Viharaya, a recently constructed Buddhist complex in Colombo, Ravana has become the object of devotion.
> In addition to erecting a Ravana statue in a shrine of his own, two annual rituals for Ravana are organized by this temple.
> In these rituals we can clearly discern the two previously mentioned conceptualizations: the Ravana *perahera* (procession) mainly concentrates on Ravana’s martial side by exalting Ravana as warrior king, and in the *maha Ravana nanumura mangalyaya*, a ritual which focusses on healing, his benevolent side as a healer is stressed.

> The focus on ritual invention in this article not only directs our attention to the creativity within the rituals but also to the wider context of these developments: the glorification of an ancient civilization as part of increased nationalistic sentiments and an increased assertiveness among the Sinhalese Buddhist majority in post-war Sri Lanka.
