Chonsong tunnel](https://en.namu.wiki/w/%EC%9B%90%ED%9A%A8%ED%84%B0%EB%84%90){:target="_blank"} hunger-strike campaign between 2002 and 2006, and lastly Venerable Munsu’s self-immolation protesting [the Four Rivers Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Major_Rivers_Project){:target="_blank"} in 2010.
