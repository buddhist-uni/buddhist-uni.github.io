> The *Other Translation of Saṃyuktāgama* 別譯雜阿含經 exists in two versions.
> The version preserved as text no. 100 in the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon is divided into sixteen fascicles, a format carried over from the Korean edition on which the compilers of the Taishō mainly relied.
> The other version, found in most editions produced in China itself, is instead divided into twenty fascicles.
> These two versions contain almost the same collection of sūtras, but differ in their arrangement.
> As regards the grouping into *Saṃyuktas*, the twenty-fascicle version is in good order while the sixteen-fascicle version is in disarray.
> This article examines the proposition by Anesaki (1908) that the sixteen-fascicle version resulted from accidental disarrangement of a text that closely resembled the twenty-fascicle version, and seeks to identify how and when this could have come about.
