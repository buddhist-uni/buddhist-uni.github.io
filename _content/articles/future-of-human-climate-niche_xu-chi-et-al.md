> All species have an environmental niche, and despite technological advances, humans are unlikely to be an exception.
> Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around 11°C–15°C mean annual temperature (MAT).

> ... in the absence of migration, [by 2070] one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT >29°C currently found in only 0.8% of the Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara.
