> This article presents an avadāna excerpt found in Śamathadeva’s Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā.
The tale reports a monk’s change of sex to female, followed by five hundred successive births as a woman, all of which happened as the karmic result of having addressed his fellow monks as women. The avadāna identifies this monk, who is introduced as a reciter of the Tripiṭaka, with the Bodhisattva in a past life.
