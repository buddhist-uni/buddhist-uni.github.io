This article examines inherent gender issues in an avadāna excerpt from Śamathadeva’s Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā. The story describes a monk who is transformed into a female body and reborn as a woman for 500 consecutive lifetimes after referring to members of the sangha as women. This excerpt appears in Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese commentaries.
