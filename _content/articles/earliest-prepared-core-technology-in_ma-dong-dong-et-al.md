> Organized flaking techniques to obtain predetermined stone tools have been traced back to the early Acheulean in Africa and are seen as indicative of the emergence of advanced technical abilities and in-depth planning skills among early humans.
> Here, we report one of the earliest known examples of prepared core technology in the archaeological record, at the Cenjiawan site in the Nihewan basin of China, dated 1.1 Mya.

Evidence that *Homo Erectus* was intentionally crafting stone tools over a million years ago in China.
