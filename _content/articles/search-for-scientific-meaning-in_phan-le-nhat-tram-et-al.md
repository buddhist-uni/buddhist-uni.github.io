> While mindfulness is a growing field of research, divergent and conflated meanings are limiting deeper interdisciplinary research.
> Interventions designed in one practice context may not be useful in other contexts because meaning is not transferred between settings.
> This review clarifies the various research domains that study mindfulness and the conceptual and operational definitions in each domain.

> The results from the scoping review show three shared domains in mindfulness classifications: short-term effects of mindfulness, long-term effects of mindfulness, and mindfulness practices.
> The results from the content mapping show four domains of mindfulness research: mental health, behavioural change, cognitive neuroscience, and ethical mindfulness.
> Operational definitions of mindfulness are not articulated clearly in these domains.


> Scholars in the ethical mindfulness domain will need solid conceptual and operational definitions to support their research efforts.
