In this article, McBride gives a nuanced view of dhāraṇī and spells during the Sui Dynasty period through the end of the Tang, roughly 500–907 C.E. For this exposition, he focuses on three Chinese intellectuals: Jingying Huiyuan (523–592), Daoshi (596–683), and Amoghavajra (705-774). All three people offer a unique understanding of dhāraṇī and spells.
