> â€¦ excavations revealed a sequence of early structures preceding the major rebuilding by Asoka

See [this post by Bhante Sujato](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/birthdate-of-the-buddha-hints-from-archeology/2591/5?u=khemarato.bhikkhu) explaining that it's quite expected that Maya would haven given birth at a pre-existing shrine.
And see [this response by Richard Gombrich](https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rfg1213.pdf) further refuting the paper's proposed chronology.

Still, the paper does inform us a bit about the site as Maya must have found it: a ~200-year-old outdoor shrine with thick wooden fencing around a central tree.
