> We
very much doubt that most Thai Buddhists would be bothered by any need to distinguish
a “miraculous” category. Their traditional religion teaches that at the highest level of
enlightenment all forms are illusions; thus the whole world and everything in it can be 
interpreted as metaphors or “names” ultimately. Nothing in such a world can, in essence, 
ever be real or unreal, illogical or logical in the Western Aristotelian sense.

> The murals are an assertion of certain core values expressed in ancient Buddhist symbols as a defense of the totality of the religious system against perceived threats from competing modern values.

> [These] murals help to
make Buddhist ideas concrete
