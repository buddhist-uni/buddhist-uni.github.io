> Care typically emerges in the context of close personal relationships, and it is not well suited to either utilitarian or Kantian accounts of morality, or to “social contract” accounts of cooperation.
> Markets and states both have difficulty providing and supporting care, and as a result, care is overlooked and undervalued.
> I sketch alternative ways of thinking about the morality and politics of care and present alternative policies that could help support carers and those they care for.
