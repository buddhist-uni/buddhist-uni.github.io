> Four monks’ life narratives, two from the Vipassana group and two from the Vidayagom group, are used as case studies.
> The study reveals that the narratives of these monks follow the structure of the Buddha’s life due to the Buddhist tradition of using the Buddha’s life as a paradigm to compose religious persons’ stories.
> However, the miraculous power of each monk is highlighted in his narrative.
> There is both miraculous power as found in the Buddhist canon and as influenced by Thai cultural beliefs and practices.
