> … the subject indicated extremely high magnitude of
reward, [yet] the objective activation
of the reward system was not extreme.

> When most other cortical activity is
reduced, a much smaller reward signal
can be detected and will be perceived as more intense than
when cortical “noise” from other sources is high, as in
normal awareness. Indeed, during normal awareness it takes
drug-induced hyperstimulation of the dopamine pathways to
generate such extreme subjective reports. If this signal-to-noise view is correct, then jhana’s reduced sense awareness
is not incidental to achieving extreme pleasure but is a
contributing condition.
