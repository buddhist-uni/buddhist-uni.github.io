> This article presents an overview of various ways in which Buddhists and Muslims have lived together in Indonesia since the arrival of Islam about 1200.
> It tells how Buddhism has slowly disappeared and become a religion for mainly the Chinese who, until the late 19th century, have often converted to Islam.

> This article analyzes the role of three key figures in the recent government–supported revival of Buddhism.
> These figures are the Chinese–Indonesian monk Ashin Jinarakkhita, the Balinese lay devotee and government official Oka Diputhera, and the Chinese–Indonesian businesswoman Sri Hartati Murdaya.
> They have tried to accommodate Buddhism to the Muslim–dominated nationalism of modern Indonesia.
> The result of the past five decades is that Buddhism has obtained a modest but safe position in independent Indonesia.
