> In  recent  years  the  community  of  Tibetan  Buddhists  has  been  agitated  by  an  intense  dispute  concerning  the  practice  of  a  controversial  deity,  Gyel-chen  Dor-je  Shuk-den. Several  Tibetan  monks  have  been  brutally  murdered,  and  the  Tibetan  community  in  general  and  the  Geluk  tradition  in  particular  have  become  profoundly  polarized. [...] Why  is  Shugden  so controversial? 

An excellent explainer of the Dalai Lama's antipathy towards this peculiar Gelug protector.
