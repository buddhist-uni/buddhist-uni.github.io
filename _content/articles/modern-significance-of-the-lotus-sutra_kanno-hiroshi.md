> The Buddha saves all living beings. If we consider this from the perspective of living beings themselves, we may paraphrase this to say that everyone has equal access to Buddhahood. This idea is expounded in the Lotus S큰tra in the concept of the "one Buddha vehicle."

It emphasizes the basic tenets found in the Lotus S큰tra and gives a detailed explanation of each.
