> ... because I have discerned the teachings by perceiving my own mind, I feel
respect for the tradition that bases itself on mind [i.e., Chan]. 
Moreover, because I have understood the cultivation of mind by discerning the teachings, I have reverent regard for the meaning of the teachings.

This paper provides a close reading of a few lines from the beginning of Zongmi's *Comprehensive Preface to the Collected Writings on the Source of Chan (Chányuán zhūquánjí dūxù 禪源諸詮集都序)*, written in 833.

> This passage is of special interest because in it Zongmi gives an account of what might be called an 'enlightenment experience' that he had, which provides the basis on which he claims unique authority to be able to resolve the central problem that the text addresses: to bridge the gap between textualists and meditators so as to make the tradition whole again.
