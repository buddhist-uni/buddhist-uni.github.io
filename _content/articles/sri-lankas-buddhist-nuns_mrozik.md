> One of the ironies of the
bhikkhuni controversy in
Sri Lanka is that both sides
seem to believe that the
very integrity of Theravāda
Buddhism is at stake in the
bhikkhuni revival.

Despite controversy over its legitimacy, the bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka has grown with increasing support from laypeople and even some monks, though challenges remain including the lack of formal recognition and tensions with the traditional *dasasil* nuns.
