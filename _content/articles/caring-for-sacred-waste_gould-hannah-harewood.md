> old altars are increasingly encountered as surplus goods by those who lack the
space, ritual expertise, or inclination to care for them. Like other forms of sacred
waste (like human corpses), disposal is complicated for practical and moral reasons,
and often requires the performance of special rites (供養 kuyō).
