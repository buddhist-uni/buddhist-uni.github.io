> Describing their experiences participating in PoC group sits and activities, a recurring 
sentiment was the embodied feeling of being relaxed, and feeling safe and comfortable.

> Drawing upon ethnographic research conducted in California with BIPOC 
practitioners of mindfulness, this article examines their efforts to create “safe spaces”
to collectively experience and process painful embodied emotions around racialized 
trauma. These collective spaces, I argue, help meditators move from experiencing 
painful emotions as internal to their personal experience as individuals, and instead 
help relate their difficult emotions with those experienced and shared by other 
racialized minorities.
