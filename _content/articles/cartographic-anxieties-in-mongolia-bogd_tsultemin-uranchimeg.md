> Mongolia's last ruler, the Bogd Khan (1870–1924) commissioned the artist Balduugin Sharav to produce a large painting of the Mongol countryside titled "Daily Events", a work that constitutes an unusual cartographic “picture-map” intended for a special public display.
> The work (now known as "One Day in Mongolia") depicts the Mongolian people as a distinct ethnic group in quotidian scenes of Central Mongolian (*Khalkha*) nomadic life.
> This article demonstrates how the covert connections between the scenes together construct a Buddhist didactic narrative of the Wheel of Life, and argues that this picture-map was the result of the Tibetan-born ruler's anxieties over ethnic identity, national unity, and the survival of his people, who strove for independence from the Qing, as well as their safe positioning vis-a-vis new political neighbors.
