> Students who are well-trained in Mindfulness cope
with dukkha in a very different fashion from the rest
of us whose minds are still at the “drunken monkey”
stage.

Dr. Ashby explores how human suffering (*dukkha*) is not merely an external condition but is compounded by our internal responses, such as clinging, aversion, and self‑identification. She argues that by understanding and transforming these reactions, one can see suffering clearly and move toward its cessation.
