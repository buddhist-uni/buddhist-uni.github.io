> For early Buddhism, I mediate between two polarized views: one promoting the idea of 'eco-dharma' as a reflection of Buddhism's alignment with non-violence (ahiṃsā), and the alleviation of suffering (dukkha); a second arguing that early Buddhist traditions have been misappropriated by western environmentalism.
> I argue that the latter view subscribes to canonical models of passive monks removed from worldly concerns, despite archaeological evidence for socially-engaged monastic landlordism from the late centuries BCE.
> Others cite this evidence only to negate Buddhism's eco-credentials, overlooking the human:non-human entanglement theme

> Case studies include examples of Buddhist land and water management in central India, set within discussions of human v.
> non-human-centric frameworks of well-being and suffering, purity and pollution, and broader Indic medico-ecological epistemologies, as possible models for collective responses to environmental stress.
