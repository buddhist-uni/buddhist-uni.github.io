> Geluk philosophers emphasize the interdependence — the relational nature of things (the internal and external, and the ultimate and conventional). Indeed, the argument for universal emptiness from the premise of interdependence is often called “the king of arguments.” 

This article by Dr. Douglas Duckworth provides an in-depth exploration of the Gelukpa (Gelug) tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, emphasizing its distinctive philosophical approach rooted in the teachings of Tsongkhapa (1357–1419).
