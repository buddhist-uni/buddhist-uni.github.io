In this essay, the author focuses on the articulation of Buddhist environmentalism that he calls “holistic eco-Buddhism”, "one that draws on the Madhyamaka/Huayan doctrines of dependent origination
(pratītyasamutpāda) and mutual non-obstruction (無礙 wu’ai) for inspiration towards a “holistic” or “deep ecological” environmental ethic founded on identification with the natural world."
