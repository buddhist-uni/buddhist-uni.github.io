In this article, Bhikkhu Analayo looks at both the Chinese and Pāli versions of the Milindapañha, a classical Buddhist text that deals with the idea of no-self. Analayo begins by briefly discussing the basic principles of debate, followed by translations of both Chinese and Pali texts with his own comments at the end of each section.
