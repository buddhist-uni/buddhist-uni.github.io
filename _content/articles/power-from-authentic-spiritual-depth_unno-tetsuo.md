> Ultimately, then, religions derive their power
from the depth of their spirituality. The power
of Zen, for example, flows out of Tokusan's
"Thirty Blows" or Rinzai's "Katsu!! '"' or Josltu's
"Mu" ("Emptiness"). The power of Shodo Shinshu also originates from one single point of
absolute depth: from the nembutsu

Unno examines how religious power and influence emerge from deep inner spirituality rather than external institutions, illustrated through historical figures in Zen and Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism.
