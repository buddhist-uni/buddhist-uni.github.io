> To better understand how meditation influences the sensory experience, we used arterial spin labeling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the neural mechanisms by which mindfulness meditation influences pain in healthy human participants.
> After 4 d of mindfulness meditation training, meditating in the presence of noxious stimulation significantly reduced pain unpleasantness by 57% and pain intensity ratings by 40% when compared to rest.
