> This article presents research on one traditionalist group, *Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition* (FPMT).
It describes FPMT’s engagement, identifies its motivations, objectives, and activities, and examines the possibility that it represents a type of engagement that can be called “traditionalist.”

This article builds on [*Beyond Queen and King*](/content/articles/beyond-queen-and-king_brown-donna)'s theoretical work by considering one such under-studied "traditionalist, engaged" Buddhist organization.
