> exposure to a stereotype, regardless of whether one agrees with it, can shape how one experiences and learns from interactions with members of the stereotyped group, such that it induces individual-level prejudice

> Computational modeling revealed that this preference was due to stereotype effects on priors regarding group members' behavior as well as the learning rates through which reward associations were updated in response to player feedback.
> We then show that these stereotype-induced preferences, once formed, spread unwittingly to others who observe these interactions, illustrating a pathway through which stereotypes may be transmitted and propagated between society and individuals.
