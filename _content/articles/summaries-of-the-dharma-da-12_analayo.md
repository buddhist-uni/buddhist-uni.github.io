A translation of the twelfth discourse in the Chinese Dīrgha-āgama with a short introduction by Bhikkhu Anālayo.

This discourse, without known parallels, is a reminder that, however important the development of wholesome mental states and the elimination of unwholesome mental states, it is equally important to also develop those states conducive to Nirvāṇa if you want to escape Saṃsāra.
