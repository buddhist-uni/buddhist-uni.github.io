A translation of a medieval, Sri Lankan letter summarizing the Dhamma in Pāli verse for a friend. 

The (possibly tenth century?) epistle had some influence on later summaries of the doctrine.
It shows how essential cosmology and ethics has been for the preservation and dissemination of "the True Dhamma."

This article contains just the translation from [Hazlewood's 1983 Master's thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20200214035718if_/https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/11296/1/Hazlewood_A.A._1983.pdf) on the text.
