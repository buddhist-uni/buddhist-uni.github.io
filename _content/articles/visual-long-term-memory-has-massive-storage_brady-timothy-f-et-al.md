> we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image.
> Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h.
> Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen.

> The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose.
> Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92%, 88%, and 87%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images.
