> Although some parts of the manuscript are still unavailable, and others are most probably lost forever, it is now possible to reconstruct the original structure of the collection with such a high degree of probability as to come close to certainty. In the following pages first a survey of all the sūtras contained in the Dirghāgama will be given, and then, second, a specimen edition of a section of one of those sūtras.
