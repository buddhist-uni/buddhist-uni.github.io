> Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks.
> Rice farmers coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor contributions.
> Rice villages also established strong norms of reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as dryland crops like wheat.
> In line with this theory, China's historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and urbanization.
