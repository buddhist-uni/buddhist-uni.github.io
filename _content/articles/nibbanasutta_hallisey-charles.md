> This sequence of images of cities may lie behind the location of Nibbāna at the pinnacle of a cosmological hierarchy as has been frequently noted in ethnographic studies of contemporary Theravādin Buddhism.

> The *Nibbānasutta* displays, at least in part, the processes through which summaries and new suttas were created in the Theravāda tradition.

A late, apocryphal "sutta" in the Theravāda tradition, building on [the famous simile of Nibbāna as a hidden, jungle city](/content/canon/sn12.65).
