> The cockfight (*tetadjen; sabungan*) is a means of expression; its function is neither to assuage social passions nor to heighten them, but, in a medium of feathers, blood, crowds, and money, to display them. [...] Attending cockfights and participating in them is, for the Balinese, a kind of sentimental education.

> Societies, like lives, contain their own interpretations.
