> Tantra is an important part of the path to liberation in the Geluk tradition. It is a path to liberation that is held to involve distinct, esoteric methods, but without diverging from the philosophical view of emptiness, which is indispensable. 

This encyclopedia entry on the Gelukpa school outlines its foundational principles, emphasizing the teachings of Je Tsongkhapa, who established the school in the 14th century. Known for its rigorous academic approach, it integrates philosophy, ethics, meditation, and tantric practices to guide practitioners towards enlightenment.
