> The importance of Abhidhamma (higher doctrine) in Myanmar Buddhist society is well known.
> However, it is only within the last century that this doctrine has become more accessible to the laity, and specifically to women devotees.

> During the colonial era, a considerable number of literate women were part of a “growing reading public,” and I argue that Burmese laywomen created a “demand” for learning Buddhist doctrine, with monks then creating a “supply”.
