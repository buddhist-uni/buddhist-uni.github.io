> For many Chinese speakers in China and elsewhere, experiencing or connecting with matters of religion often includes mediation through or with material objects.
> Such mediation is readily accessible to larger and larger audiences and often occurs through the consumption of religious material goods, thanks also to media technologies and the Internet.
> In this article, the author seeks to complicate the notion that the production and consumption of novel Buddhist religious goods can be analyzed solely in terms of ‘market theory.’
> While on the one hand the author shows that Buddhist technologies of salvation are historically associated with materiality, she also contends that the ‘aura’ of Buddhist-inspired modern religious goods is not so much effaced as it is reconfigured and transformed by technological mediations.
