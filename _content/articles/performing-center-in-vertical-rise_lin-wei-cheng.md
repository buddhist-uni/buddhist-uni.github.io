> An unprecedented number of multilevel pagodas were built in China from the tenth through the thirteenth century.
This growing emphasis on verticality, in contrast to the usual horizontal sprawl of China's building tradition, raises questions about what "height" meant in the history of Chinese architecture.
This essay argues that the height of the multilevel pagoda was necessarily performative:
not so much because the pagoda served as a means of ascending to that height, but because it drew the attention of the faithful.
