A thorough overview of the monastic hierarchy in Thailand as it appeared from the perspective of the monks and laymen of Chiang Mai in the early 1970s.

The paper explains how the hierarchy emerged historically out of the attempts by the Siamese government to exercise control over the monasteries and how its rigid hierarchy is tempered by the Thai sense of "suitability" leading to an organization that balances central goals against local concerns.
Each level of the hierarchy and the parallel system of royally-bestowed honorifics are explained in detail, including their qualifications and responsibilities.
