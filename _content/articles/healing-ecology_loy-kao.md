> Loy’s remarks do not neatly divide into two types: those directed primarily at Buddhists on account of their (presumably) shared 
metaphysics and ontology, and those aimed at a general audience in 
light of the universality of the prescriptions and effects of his plan to 
heal the biosphere. Quite the contrary, Loy’s central thesis is that there 
are common “spiritual roots” to our ecological crisis and that the Buddhist soteriological structure, when properly understood and applied
from the individual to the collective case, holds the key to our way out.
Loy’s wish is not simply that we all “stop befoul[ing] our own nest” in 
the ways already mentioned, but that we all “awaken” to the true causes 
of environmental spoilage—our false belief in an ultimate “separation 
from other people and from the natural world” and our dysfunctional 
striving after “ever-increasing power and control” as a way of resolving 
our collective anxiety about what it means to be human. If these points 
weren’t proof enough of Loy’s unwillingness to play by any Maritainian 
or Rawlsian-inspired rules of compartmentalization, there is also his direct appeal to religions to change their internal lives: to “stop denying 
evolution and instead refocus their messages on its meaning.”
