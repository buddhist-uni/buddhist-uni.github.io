> The fact that narratives have the potential to be an “act of social
imagination” and serve as the foundation for moral agency fits well into
Shabkar’s own understandings of the functions of Buddhist life stories. 

This essay explores how Shabkar's autobiography makes an indirect case for vegetarianism and ethical treatment of animals. By portraying animals as important participants in his stories, Shabkar shifts the focus from a human-centered view to one of impartiality. This approach, an example of the “act of social imagination,"  subtly encourages a vegetarian lifestyle and stands out from other Tibetan Buddhist arguments for vegetarianism. Shabkar’s storytelling invites readers to imagine a more ethical way of living, which helps build the foundation for moral choices.
