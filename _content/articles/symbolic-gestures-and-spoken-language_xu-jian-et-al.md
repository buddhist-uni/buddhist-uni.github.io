> Symbolic gestures, such as pantomimes that signify actions (e.g., threading a needle) or emblems that facilitate social transactions (e.g., finger to lips indicating "be quiet"), play an important role in human communication.
> They are autonomous, can fully take the place of words, and function as complete utterances in their own right.
> The relationship between these gestures and spoken language remains unclear.
> We used fMRI to investigate whether these two forms of communication are processed by the same system in the human brain.


> We suggest that these anterior and posterior perisylvian areas, identified since the mid-19th century as the core of the brain's language system, are not in fact committed to language processing, but may function as a modality-independent semiotic system that plays a broader role in human communication, linking meaning with symbols whether these are words, gestures, images, sounds, or objects.
