> Changes in gray matter concentration were investigated using voxel-based morphometry, and compared with a waiting list control group of 17 individuals.
> Analyses in a priori regions of interest confirmed increases in gray matter concentration within the left hippocampus.
> Whole brain analyses identified increases in the posterior cingulate cortex, the temporo-parietal junction, and the cerebellum in the MBSR group compared with the controls.
> The results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.
