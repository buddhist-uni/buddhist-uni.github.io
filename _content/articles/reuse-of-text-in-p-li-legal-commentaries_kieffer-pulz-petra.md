> We will examine three types of reuse represented in Pāli legal literature: (1) unacknowledged borrowings of authoritative opinions and definitions adapted and rearranged; (2) unacknowledged borrowings of largely unchanged selected text portions being rearranged; and (3) unconnected extracts of unchanged text portions lined up in the sequence of the source text.
