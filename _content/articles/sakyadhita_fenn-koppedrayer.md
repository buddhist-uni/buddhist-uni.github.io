> Pomp and ceremony opened the conference and then the activities settled into a daily pattern...

> Its conveners outlined an ambitious set of objectives, including improved opportunities for women to study dharma and the establishment of a full bhikshuni ordination in the Theravada and Tibetan traditions.
> Central to Sakyadhita’s mission has been a series of biannual international conferences that provide opportunities for Buddhist women across cultures to come together to share their experiences and learn from each other.
> The interactions and exchanges that occur at these conferences highlight the issues and concerns the Buddhist women bring to a transnational forum, while also offering insight into the feasibility of Sakyadhita’s purpose.
