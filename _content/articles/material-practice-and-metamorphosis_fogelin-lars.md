> Where earlier stupas were icons and indexes of the Buddha encased within indexes of his presence, later stupas were symbols of the Buddha and Buddhist theology.
> This change in the material practice of Buddhism reduced stupas ’ emotional immediacy in favor of greater intellectual detachment.
> In the end, this shift in the meaning ascribed to stupas created the preconditions from which the Buddhist image cult and Mahayana Buddhism emerged in the first through fifth centuries A.D.
> The development of Mahayana Buddhism and Buddha images signified a return to iconic worship of the Buddha.
