> What happens to the meaning of Buddhist rituals in military spaces?
Do the military confines and the political context alter the meaning of “non-violent” rituals? Can they become “violent” rituals?

During the Sri Lankan civil war, some extremist Buddhist monks espoused an explicitly violent "just war" ideology.
While the majority of Sinhala monks did not go that far, they still demonstrated their support indirectly, through e.g. the chanting of *pirit*s before major battles.
