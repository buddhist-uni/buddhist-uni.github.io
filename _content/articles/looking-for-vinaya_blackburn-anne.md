> This paper introduces a new distinction between the 'formal' and the 'practical' canon[...] in medieval Sri Lanka. I show that few monks encountered the [Vinaya] in anything close to its full form.  
[Rather,] Monastic leaders considered the *Anumāna*, *Dasadhamma* and *(Karaniya)metta* Suttas to be [the important sources] for monastic education.

In ancient times, Monastic students would memorize their texts while in modern times the trend is for students to more lightly engage with a larger corpus.
