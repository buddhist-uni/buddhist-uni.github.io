> The faith proclaimed by the Patriarchs of the Pure Land schools is founded on a myth;
a myth in the religious sense of a 'story' which gives a viable framework to the world,
until we can discover the ultimate truth which cannot be put into words.

The article discusses the Pure Land school of Buddhism in Japan, exploring topics such as faith, the concept of mappo, the final stage of the Buddhist law, and the two types of effort, i.e. jiriki (one's self-power) and tariki (other-power), that can lead to awakening.
