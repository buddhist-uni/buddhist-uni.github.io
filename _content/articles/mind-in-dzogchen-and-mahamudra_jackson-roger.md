> Gelugpas, on the other hand, were antagonistic to other-emptiness, and
in their Mahamudra system, the emptiness of mind that must be discovered through insight
meditation is a negation pure and simple, without any implication that mind’s ultimate nature
includes positive qualities, not even luminosity

Roger R. Jackson explores how Dzogchen and Mahamudra, two prominent Tibetan Buddhist traditions, approach the nature of mind. Both traditions emphasize the recognition of the mind's inherent qualities—emptiness, purity, luminosity, and awareness—as essential for spiritual liberation. While Dzogchen focuses on direct recognition of the primordial mind, Mahamudra offers a more gradual path, blending meditative practices with philosophical insights. Despite differences in methodology, both traditions ultimately aim to uncover the same underlying reality, highlighting a profound unity within Tibetan Buddhism.
