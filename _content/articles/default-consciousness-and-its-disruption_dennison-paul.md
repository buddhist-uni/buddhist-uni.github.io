> The first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation.
> While remaining highly alert and "present" in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display "spindle" activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma.
