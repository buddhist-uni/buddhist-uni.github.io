This article discusses the history of talismans in Central Asian Buddhism and their origin in East Asia, particularly through Daoism. For the Uyghurs, a Turkic people who converted to Buddhism in Central Asia, talismans were linked to esoteric Buddhism, as shown through texts found in the Dunhuang. The article ends with a look at talismans in Old Uyghur texts.
