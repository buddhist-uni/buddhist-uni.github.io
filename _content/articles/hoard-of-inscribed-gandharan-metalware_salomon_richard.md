This article details several objects—bowls, ladles, and cups—unearthed in the ancient Gandharan region. Specifically, it delineates the first-century CE silver objects, presumably contributed to a Sarvāstivādin monastery known as Utarode(v)a. These objects bear inscriptions providing historical, sectarian, and social insights into their donation, thereby shedding light on Buddhism in the region.
