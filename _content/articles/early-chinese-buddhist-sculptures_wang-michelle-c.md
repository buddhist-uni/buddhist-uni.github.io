> Miracle tales from medieval China recorded the ability of Buddhist statues to walk, 
speak, emit light, and even feel pain. Consecration ceremonies, however, emphasized the sense of vision and the agency of the ritual practitioner over the agency of 
the statue. This essay argues that by underscoring the corporeal agency of animated 
sculptures, which was manifested both in their extraordinary qualities and in their 
vulnerability to damage, the circulation of miracle tales enabled a participatory 
practice in which devotees, monks and laypeople alike, were able to engage in the 
performative act of writing statues into life.
