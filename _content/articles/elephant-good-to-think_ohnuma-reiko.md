> He thinks and he 
feels, but – as far as I can tell – he does not speak, nor is he simply 
the previous animal rebirth of an eventual human being. There is 
something powerful, I contend, about the mute presence of such an 
animal – its noble silence, its freedom from the glibness of human 
language

Using the story of the Buddha's stay in the Pārileyyaka forest, this article highlights the use and importance of animals in Buddhist literature and the commonality among pan-Indian literature more generally. Further, the author brings together much of past research on the use of anmials in Buddhist literature, adding to her own insights.
