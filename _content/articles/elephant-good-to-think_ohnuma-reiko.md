Using the story of the Buddha's stay in the Pārileyyaka forest, this article highlights the use and importance of animals in Buddhist literature and the commonality among pan-Indian literature more generally. Further, the author brings together much of past research on the use of anmials in Buddhist literature, adding to her own insights.
