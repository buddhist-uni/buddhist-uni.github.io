> The Buddha spoke of two kinds of desire: desire that arises from ignorance and delusion which is called taṇhā – craving – and desire that arises from wisdom and intelligence, which is called kusala-chanda, or dhamma-chanda, or most simply chanda.

Adapted from a Dhamma talk of Ajahn Jayasāro, this article explains the role that skilful desires (chanda) and the four right exertions (sammappadhāna) play in a practitioner's development.
