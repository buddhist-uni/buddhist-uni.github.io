> In the mixture with rags, strings and pegs together, well it was my image [*rūpa*].  
So in the mixture with bone, flesh and sinews it is the individual *rūpa* of living beings.  
If I divide the body parts apart, there is no individuality by name.  
As my love was in rags, so it is in the body. Oh, blind passion!

A series of Jātaka stories and poems from Tocharian fragments.
