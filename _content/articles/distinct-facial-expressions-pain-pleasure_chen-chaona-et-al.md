> Using complementary analyses, we show that representations of pain and orgasm are distinct in each culture.
> We also show that pain is represented with similar face movements across cultures, whereas orgasm shows differences.
> Our findings therefore inform understanding of the possible communicative role of facial expressions of pain and orgasm, and how culture could shape their representation.
