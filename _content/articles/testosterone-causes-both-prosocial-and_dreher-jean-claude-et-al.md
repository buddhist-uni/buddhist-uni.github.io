> Administration of testosterone caused increased punishment of the other player but also increased reward of larger offers.

> This increased generosity in the absence of provocation indicates that testosterone can also cause prosocial behaviors that are appropriate for increasing status.
> These findings are in-consistent with a simple relationship between testosterone and aggression and provide causal evidence for a more complex role for testosterone in driving status-enhancing behaviors in males.
