This article examines the "temple wife problem:" that the wives of Sōtō Zen Priests are expected to manage their husband's temples but receive no official status or support for their labor.

Focusing on public hearings held in 2006 in which temple wives (*jizoku*) aired their grievances, the article examines the unique challenges that Japanese Zen must confront since the Meiji Reforms eliminated celibacy from the priesthood.
