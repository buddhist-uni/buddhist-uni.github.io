> Translators of short Buddhist chants in Southeast Asia, including Hộ Tông and his Siamese and Khmer predecessors, tend to follow three unstated principles:
>  1. the translation may be longer than its source, but rarely vice versa
>  2. even when translated into the vernacular, the Pali source ought to be retained, and
>  3. the resulting bilingual Pali-vernacular chant should bring its performance practices—gestures, melodies, and rhythms—into harmony.  

> These principles are crucial for understanding the historical processes that made the transmission of Theravada Buddhism across Southeast Asia possible.
