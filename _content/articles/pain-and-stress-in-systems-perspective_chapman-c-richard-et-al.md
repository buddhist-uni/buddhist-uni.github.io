> Acute tissue injury activates an ensemble of interdependent nervous, endocrine, and immune processes that operate in concert and comprise a supersystem.
> Some chronic pain conditions result from supersystem dysregulation.
> Individuals vary and are vulnerable to dysregulation due to the unique interactions of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors and past experiences that characterize each person.
