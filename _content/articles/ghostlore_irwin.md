> Spirits, ghosts, fairies, demons, or speaking collectively, 'pi' (ผี) may be divided into three classes:
'Pi' which are the ghosts of the dead or living;
'pi' which exist on their own account, and do not originate from human beings;
and thirdly 'pi' belonging to other worlds...

Some field notes on Thai ghost beliefs and related rituals at the turn of the twentieth century.

For ผี beliefs in Thailand half a century later, see [Rajathon, 1954](/content/articles/phi_rajathon-phya).
