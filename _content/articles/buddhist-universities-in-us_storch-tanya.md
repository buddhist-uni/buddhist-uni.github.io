> These universities provide education in liberal arts and professional fields, while employing the time-tested methods of traditional Buddhist pedagogy.
> Because these universities are generally unknown to the public, I have provided information about their history, academic programs, and the educational success created on their campuses.


> In each country to which it historically spread, Buddhism created schools, universities, and various centers for learning, meditation, and moral practicea.
> In the USA, a great variety of Buddhist-based institutions of learning were created during the last half of the 20th century.
> These include, but are not limited to kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools, institutes for vocational training, and universities granting professional degrees.
> In this article, we will investigate one particular type of Buddhist educational institution, which we refer to as a "Buddhist University."
