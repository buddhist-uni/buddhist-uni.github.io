> Jātakas are often associated with specific locations, both within the land of Buddhism’s birth, and in other parts of Asia.
> There are records suggesting that such locations became early pilgrimage sites; contemporary sources also make reference to ‘local’ jātakas, which in many cases help to assimilate Buddhism into the local culture through its geography.

> In this article I will argue that it is the structure of jātaka stories that allows this localisation to take place all over Asia.
> I contend that since the jātakas themselves are lacking in specific external referents they can easily be given a location, whilst their framing in the ‘present’ time of the Buddha’s teaching career grounds the stories in both time and place, without infringing on the flexibility of the individual stories.
> This ability to provide centrally legitimated relevance for each and all contributes greatly to the popularity and endurance of the jātaka genre.
