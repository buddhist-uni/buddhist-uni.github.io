> This study examines the early career of the renowned Buddhologist Lü Cheng as an aspiring revolutionary.
> My findings reveal that Lü's rhetoric of "aesthetic revolution" both catapulted him into the center of the New Culture Movement and popularized a Buddhist idealism—Yogācāra—among thinkers who sought alternative social theories.

> Buddhist soteriology supplied 
powerful tools for theorizing the social: The doctrine of no-self refuted philosophical 
solipsism and curtailed individualism; dependent-origination refashioned social 
evolution as collective spiritual progress.
