> The Mekong region presents a record incidence of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer).
> Scientists identify correlations between the development of this aggressive disease and the consumption of raw fish in local dishes.
> While made aware of these correlations by comprehensive health campaigns, some villagers in Thailand’s notoriously neglected Northeast refuse to cook the fish before consumption

> Based on ethnographic data, this paper suggests that practices surrounding the consumption of raw food in the area have become taboo.
> Rather than disappearing, they now play a key role in bonding rituals where rural masculinities are expressed via spectacles of risk taking that transgress normative ideals of manhood as epitomised by urban men and Buddhist monks.
