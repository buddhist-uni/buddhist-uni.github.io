> Experimental reports rich in circumstantial detail were designed to enable readers of the text to create a mental image of an experimental scene they did not directly witness.
> I call this `virtual witnessing', and its importance was as a means of enlarging the witnessing public.
> The notion of a `public' for experimental science is, I argue, essential to our understanding of how facts are generated and validated.
> In these episodes, circumstantial reporting was a technique for creating a public and thus constituting authentic knowledge.
