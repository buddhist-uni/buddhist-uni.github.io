> Paralleling the reinvention of Christmas in the modern period, Buddhists reconfigured the Buddha's birthday as a symbol of their religious identity and power.
> The Buddha's Birthday festival should be understood in the context of increasing contact and exchange among Buddhists in the East and the West.
> The festival's prominence was the result of complex negotiation and collaboration between Korean and Japanese Buddhists who both hoped the festival would advance their overlapping visions of Buddhism.
> The festival was not so much an imposition of the colonizer on a native culture as it was a dynamic, creative feature of modern Korean Buddhism in a colonial context.
