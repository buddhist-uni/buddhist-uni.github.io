> Among the general public and behavioral scientists alike, the Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the best known and most widely used tool for demonstrating implicit bias: the unintentional impact of social group information on behavior.

> The idea that racial bias exists in places more so than in people can be a disorienting idea for many of us born and raised within cultures that predominantly treat places as neutral and passive while prioritizing the importance of individual actors and their internal states and motivations.
> In general, when most of us think about a concept like sexism, we think about people (like misogynists). We are unlikely to think about spaces causing people to be sexist.
