> Sixteen patients underwent functional MRI while reacting to negative self-beliefs and while regulating negative emotions using 2 types of attention deployment emotion regulation: breath-focused attention (MBSR) and distraction-focused attention (counting backwards).

> Compared with baseline, MBSR completers showed improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms and self-esteem.
> During the breath-focused attention task (but not the distraction-focused attention task), they also showed (a) decreased negative emotion experience, (b) reduced amygdala activity, and (c) increased activity in brain regions implicated in attentional deployment.
> MBSR training in patients with SAD may reduce emotional reactivity while enhancing emotion regulation.
