> This article uses a Himalayan Buddhist lens to critically interrogate a fundamental premise of 'the Anthropocene'---that the epoch commemorates a 'newfound' capacity of humans to mobilise Earth forces.
> Rather, Himalayan Buddhism has long held that humans wield geological agency, mobilised through relationships with territorial landscape deities, which inflict severe weather in retaliation for human moral infractions.

> Offering an alternative model of anthropogenic climate change, Buddhist and Indigenous lifeworlds challenge Western convictions that 'the Anthropocene' is a novel planetary epoch.
> Since the term has gained a vibrant discursive life beyond geology, its cultural assumptions---rather than biophysical thresholds---are primarily evaluated, revealing an extension of Eurocentric colonial logic into this new planetary chapter.
> Alternatively, I suggest the Himalayan Buddhist term 'kawa nyampa' (degenerate era) better encapsulates our transition towards environmental breakdown.
> There was no need to 'invent' the Anthropocene as a new epoch of thought---it had long already existed.
