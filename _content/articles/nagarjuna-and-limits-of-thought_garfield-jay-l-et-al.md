> Nagarjuna seems willing to embrace contradictions while at the same time making use of classic reductio arguments.
> He asserts that he rejects all philosophical views including his own-that he asserts nothing-and appears to mean it.
> It is argued here that he, like many philosophers in the West and, indeed, like many of his Buddhist colleagues, discovers and explores true contradictions arising at the limits of thought.
> For those who share a dialetheist's comfort with the possibility of true contradictions commanding rational assent, for Nagarjuna to endorse such contradictions would not undermine but instead confirm the impression that he is indeed a highly rational thinker.
> It is argued that the contradictions he discovers are structurally analogous to many discovered by Western philosophers and mathematicians.
