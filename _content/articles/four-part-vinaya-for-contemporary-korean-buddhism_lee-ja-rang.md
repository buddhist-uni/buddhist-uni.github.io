> During the Chosŏn period (1392–1910), the discussion of precepts all
but disappeared from the religious discourse in Korean Buddhism. Not
only were the precepts left unstudied, but even the performance of official
ordination ceremonies for new monks based on the precepts ceased.

This article examines the challenges the modern Chogye Order of Korea faces in applying traditional monastic discipline. It shows how modernization has led the Order to modify or abandon key Vinaya principles, increasingly turning to secular rules and norms instead.
