> The article first identifies
and assesses two different strategies used by advocates of
Buddhist environmentalism in Thailand, one being textual
and the other practical.
Then, after laying out the
deficiencies of the textual strategy, the article argues that
the practical strategy offers a more meaningful basis for a
discourse of Buddhist environmental concern.
