> animals are not passive objects for humans to ignore or argue over--or collect--but "individuals with their own perspectives on life," and members of communities with which our species coexists. That animals are in this sense political actors is an underrecognized and, to my mind, potentially powerful point

What can we learn, and what kind of world would we build, if we learned how to listen to animals?
