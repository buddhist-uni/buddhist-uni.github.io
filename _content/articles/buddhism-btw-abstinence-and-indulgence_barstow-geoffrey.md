> Tibetan Buddhism has long argued for the sanctity of life, condemning the killing of humans and animals alike.
> For just as long, however, meat has been a staple of the Tibetan diet.
> Individual religious leaders have dealt with this tension in different ways, but few have done so as revealingly as the eighteenth century master Jigmé Lingpa ('jigs med gling pa, 1730-1798).

> In his religious and autobiographical writings, Jigmé Lingpa draws on Buddhist ideals promoting compassion towards all beings and his own unusually strong love of animals to praise vegetarianism and condemn the killing of animals for meat.
> Jigmé Lingpa also recognizes, however, that vegetarianism is a difficult ideal.
> Rather than insisting on vegetarianism, therefore, he offers his students a variety of means through which to moderate the negativity of eating meat without fully abandoning it.
