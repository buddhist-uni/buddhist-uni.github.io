A brief introduction and English translation of the *Pañcagati-Dīpanaṃ* ("Illumination of the Five Realms of Existence") thought to be a Southeast Asian recension of Aśvaghoṣa's *Chagatidīpanī* (*Sadgatikārikā*?).

This text explains the five realms of rebirth and the actions which lead to rebirth in each one.
It's an excellent example of how the teaching on karma was elaborated after the Buddha's passing, and how teachings circulated around Asia even in premodern times.
