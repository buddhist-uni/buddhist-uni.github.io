> Since in the teachings of Shin Buddhism Obon itself is nothing special but provides one of
the opportunities for listening to the Buddha Dharma, there is no reason to do something
special for it. In traditions other than Shin Buddhism, however, Obon is a special, fancier
and more serious event for people to welcome their ancestors back home.

A short and humorous explanation of the Japanese tradition Obon.
