This article explores two key mythic cycles that shape Viṣṇu’s divine profile in Sri Lankan, Buddhist culture.
The first involves abbreviated Sinhala versions of episodes from the Rāmāyaṇa, which influence the portrayal of Rāma and his connection to Viṣṇu.
The second myth, widely spread in Sinhala folklore, depicts Viṣṇu as the righteous conqueror of the asura Bhasma.
