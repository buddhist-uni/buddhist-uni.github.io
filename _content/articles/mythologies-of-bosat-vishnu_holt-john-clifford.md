This article explores  two key mythic cycles that shape Viṣṇu’s divine profile in Sinhala literature and Buddhist culture. The first involves abbreviated Sinhala versions of episodes from the Hindu epic Rāmāyaṇa, which influence the portrayal of Rāma and his connection to the Viṣṇu cult in Sri Lanka. The second myth, widely spread in Sinhala folklore, depicts Viṣṇu as the conqueror of the asura Bhasma, symbolizing the association of moral power with Viṣṇu, offering insight into how these myths reflect the character of Viṣṇu within Sinhala Buddhist culture.
