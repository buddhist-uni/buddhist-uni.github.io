> One of the early functions of the talisman was for a ruler to authorize the conduct and scope of authority of a
general (e.g., how many troops he could command).
The military context
of talismans later found a corollary in the spiritual realm and permitted
their possessor to summon and control a variety of deities that could be
drawn on in battles with spirits.

> When
it came to such significant acts, such as warding off disease demons and
protecting or extending oneâ€™s life, Buddhist and Daoists were occupied
with the same types of concerns and employed a similar arsenal of powerful techniques that drew on the powers embedded in esoteric talismans.
