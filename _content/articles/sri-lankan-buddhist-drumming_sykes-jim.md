This pair of articles explains how the arhythmic quality of Sri Lankan Buddhist drum offerings is an intentional avoidance of Indian *tala* metrical theory in order to justify the drumming as as a kind of communal recitation appropriate to offer to the Buddha.

1. [South Asian Drumming Beyond *Tala*: The Problem with "Meter" in Buddhist Sri Lanka](https://iftawm.org/journal/oldsite/articles/2018a/Sykes_AAWM_Vol_6_2a.html)
2. [On the Sonic Materialization of Buddhist History: Drum Speech in Southern Sri Lanka](https://iftawm.org/journal/oldsite/articles/2018a/Sykes_AAWM_Vol_6_2b.html)
3. along with numerous [Audio and Video examples](https://iftawm.org/journal/oldsite/articles/2018a/Sykes_Captions_AAWM_Vol_6_2.html).

In this way, we should view Sri Lankan Buddhist drumming not as a simple application of pre-Buddhist rites to a nominally Buddhist context but rather as a unique, and uniquely Buddhist, art form in its own right.
