> A total of 315 participants (26%) reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences, which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice.
> Logistic regression models indicated that unpleasant meditation-related experiences were less likely to occur in female participants and religious participants.
> Participants with higher levels of repetitive negative thinking, those who only engaged in deconstructive types of meditation (e.g., vipassana), and those who had attended a meditation retreat were more likely to report unpleasant meditation-related experiences.

Underscoring the importance of engaging in meditation practices in a balanced way.
