> [This article discusses...] the perceptions of Tibetan identity within and outside of the Tibetan community, the influence of sponsorship programs in India that are based on identification, the importance of marriage, political engagement, and whether it is important to be Buddhist or not. Lastly, the role of the Dalai Lama in the eyes of the research subjects is also explored.

> To gather information about the association of second-generation Tibetans with their parentâ€™s home country, interviews with Tibetans in Switzerland and India provided valuable insights.
> The interviews were supplemented with data acquired from experts who were involved with the Tibetan diasporic community while the research was being conducted.
