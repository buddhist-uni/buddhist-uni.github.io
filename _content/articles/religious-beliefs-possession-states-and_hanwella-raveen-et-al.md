> We describe three patients from different religious backgrounds in Sri Lanka whose possession states were strongly influenced by their religious beliefs.
> Patient A was a Buddhist who claimed to have special powers given by a local deity named Paththini.
> Patient B was a Catholic who experienced spirits around her whom she believed were sent by Satan.
> Patient C was a Muslim and believed she was possessed by spirits.
> The religious beliefs also influenced the help-seeking behaviour and the rituals or treatments to which they responded.
