> Despite the decimation of traditional culture during the Khmer Rouge
period (1975–1979), Dharma songs remain an integral facet of Buddhist life
among Khmers in Cambodia and in diaspora.

This article examines the role of Dharma songs in contemporary Cambodia, highlighting how their texts, melodies, and performances evoke the aesthetic experiences of *saṃvega* and *pasāda*, central to Buddhist art and practice. It emphasizes the significance of music in expressing and living Buddhism within the Khmer tradition.
