> In Kunming, meat has long been a sign of prosperity and status.
> Its accessibility marked the successes of the economic reforms.
> Yet Kunmingers were increasingly concerned about excessive meat consumption and about the safety and quality of the meat supply.
> Buddhist vegetarian restaurants provided spaces where people could share meat-free meals and discuss and develop their concerns about meat-eating.

> While similar to and influenced by secular, Western vegetarianisms, the central role of Buddhism was reflected in discourses on karmic retribution for taking life and in a non-confrontational approach that sought to accommodate these discourses with the importance of meat in Chinese social life.
> Finally, the vegetarian restaurants spoke to middle-class projects of self-cultivation, and by doing so potentially challenged associations between meat-eating and social status.
