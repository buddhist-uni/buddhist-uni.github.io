Tibetan Buddhist philosophers interpret the doctrine of two truths—conventional and ultimate truths—as central to understanding reality, knowledge, and liberation. This Stanford Encyclopedia entry examines the different perspectives of Tibetan schools such as Nyingma, Kagyü, Sakya, and Gelug, highlighting their debates on the nature and relationship of these truths, all grounded in the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka tradition and the commentaries of Candrakīrti.
