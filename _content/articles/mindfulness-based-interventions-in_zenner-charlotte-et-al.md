> All in all, mindfulness-based interventions in children and youths hold promise, particularly in relation to improving cognitive performance and resilience to stress.
> However, the diversity of study samples, variety in implementation and exercises, and wide range of instruments used require a careful and differentiated examination of data.
> There is great heterogeneity, many studies are underpowered, and measuring effects of Mindfulness in this setting is challenging.
> The field is nascent and recommendations will be provided as to how interventions and research of these interventions may proceed.
