> I am able to show that the four phrases exemplified by “form is emptiness” were once a reference to the well-known simile, “Form is like an illusion”.
> As the  Prajnāpāramitā  corpus expanded, the simile became a metaphor, “form is illusion”.
> It was then deliberately altered by exchanging “illusion” for “emptiness”, leading to the familiar phrases.

> This connection opens the door to reading the  Heart Sutra, and the early  Prajnāpāramitā  sutras more generally, along the lines of Sue Hamilton’s epistemological approach to the Pāḷi suttas; i.e.
> as focussed on experience and particularly the meditative experience known in the Pāḷi suttas as "dwelling in emptiness."
> In this view, the  Heart Sutra  makes sense on its own terms without having to invoke paradox or mysticism.
