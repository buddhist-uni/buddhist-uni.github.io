> We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian than when they were from the same linguistic category.
> Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task.

> These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).
