> Contemporary Buddhist studies has been strongly affected by its origins in the Victorian era, when Western religious scholars sought to rationalize and historicize the study of religion.
> Modern Asian scholars, trained within the Western scholarly paradigm, share this prejudice.
> The result is a skewed understanding of Buddhism, emphasizing its philosophical and theoretical aspects at the expense of seemingly 'irrational' religious elements based on the direct experience of meditation practice.
