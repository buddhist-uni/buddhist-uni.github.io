> I present here a preliminary report on selected engraved or inscribed objects, most of them recently found in Southeast Asia. Foremost among them are those indited with the single word apramāda: ‘careful’, ‘heedful’, ‘aware’.

A few Buddhist talismans used to ward off danger in medieval Southeast Asia.
