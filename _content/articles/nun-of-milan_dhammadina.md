> The task of the coroplast was to show that the image was that of a nun. Simply relying on her 
facial features and shaven head would not have been enough to distinguish her as such. The 
two means available to convey her identity as a nun, rather than a monk, were pointers to her 
different body shape and close-up details of her monastic attire.

This article describes the history and materials of a Gandharan stucco figurine of a female Buddhist monk in the Civico Museo Archeologico in Milan, likely from Hadda. It's dated around the second century AD or later, providing rare evidence of female monastics in Gandhāra.
