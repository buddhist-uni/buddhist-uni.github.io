> In the evening I crossed the river and started for home. Then I saw the corpse running on the other side of the river. It was completely naked, but carried its belt in one hand and its boots in the other.
Then I saw a wolf coming after it, felling it to the ground.

Four stories from the Ro-langs narrative tradition explore the Tibetan belief in reanimated corpses—Ro-langs—brought back through sorcery or spirit possession, embodying the intersection of Tibetan folklore and religious beliefs of death and the supernatural.
