> One of the distinguishing features of Himalayan Buddhism
is that it has accommodated within itself a good number of
elements and traits of the pre-Buddhist indigenous religions
and folk traditions.

This paper explores how practices from Tibetan indigenous religions, particularly the use of spirit mediums and oracles, have been incorporated into Himalayan Buddhism. It argues that these pre-Buddhist elements continue to exist within Tibetan Buddhist institutions, highlighting a syncretism between the two.
