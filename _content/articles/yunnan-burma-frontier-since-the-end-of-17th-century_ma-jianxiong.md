The article discusses the development of secret societies on the Yunnan-Burma frontier, focusing on how these societies shaped the regionâ€™s political and social dynamics from the late 17th century. It highlights the role of Buddhist and Taoist sects, in fostering local leadership, cultural reconstruction, and cross-border networks, despite Qing government efforts to suppress them.
