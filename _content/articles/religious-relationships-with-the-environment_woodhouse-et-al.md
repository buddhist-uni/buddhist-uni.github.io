> This research highlights the contrast between religiously oriented understandings of the environment and Green Buddhist representations in their various guises, where they intersect, and
how elements of Green Tibetan discourse are being articulated and reshaped in one rural locality.

The authors look at the indigenous environmentalism of rural Tibet through the lenses of local gods and spirits, karma, and sīla/śīla. The article also speaks to modern influences such as capitalist development and government policies.
