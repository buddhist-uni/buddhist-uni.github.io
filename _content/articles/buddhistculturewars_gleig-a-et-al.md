> While often associated with a liberal demographic, the increasing online visibility of rhetoric such as "snowflakes," "politically correct," "postmodern identity politics," and "cultural Marxism" demonstrates the presence of right-wing sentiments and populations in American convert Buddhism.


> We chart this backlash across a broad right-wing spectrum that spans from "reactionary centrism" to the "alt-right."
> We illuminate the ways in which participants both de-legitimate "Diversity Equity and Inclusion" as political rather than Buddhist and naturalize their own position as Buddhist rather than political.
> We show how American convert Buddhist lineages have become a site of the "culture wars"...
