> The article outlines some of the ways in which professional musicians and music virtuosos among the aristocracy conceptualized gagaku and bugaku instrumental music in Buddhist terms between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries.
> In addition to providing doctrinal justifications for artistic endeavors, they also contributed to the development of new ritual forms, such as bugaku hōyō and kangen kōshiki.
> This article explores influential [Buddhist canonical ideas about music](/content/papers/sutra-of-druma-king-of-kinnara_rambelli-fabio) and shows how they were developed by musicians in medieval Japan.
