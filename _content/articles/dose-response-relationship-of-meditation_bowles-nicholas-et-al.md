> Historical meditation practice (accumulated lifetime hours) was significantly associated with favorable psychological outcomes.

> retrospective cross-sectional design precludes our ability to make causal inferences about the impact of meditation on psychological outcomes. So, while meditation practice may lead to improved psychological outcomes, it is also possible that people with better mental health may be more likely to engage in meditation, and/or sustain a meditation practice over a relatively long time duration
