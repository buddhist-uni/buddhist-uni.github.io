> In healthy adults, we found that compassion training increased altruistic redistribution of funds to a victim encountered outside of the training context.
> Furthermore, increased altruistic behavior after compassion training was associated with altered activation in brain regions implicated in social cognition and emotion regulation, including the inferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in DLPFC connectivity with the nucleus accumbens.

> These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with training and that greater altruistic behavior may emerge
