> In the poetic commentary *Nameless Notes* (1211–1216), the poet-priest Kamo no Chōmei explains that unlike prose, a poem “possesses the power to move heaven and earth, to calm demons and gods,” because, among other attributes, “it contains many truths in a single word.”

> The supernatural powers of Japanese poetry are widely documented in literature of Heian and medieval Japan.
> Twentieth-century scholars have tended to follow Orikuchi Shinobu in interpreting and discussing miraculous verses in terms of ancient (pre-Buddhist) beliefs in *kotodama*, the magic spirit power of special words.
> In this paper, I argue for application of a more contemporaneous hermeneutical approach: thirteenth-century Japanese *dharani* theory, according to which Japanese poetry is capable of supernatural effects because it contains truth (*kotowari*) in a semantic superabundance.
