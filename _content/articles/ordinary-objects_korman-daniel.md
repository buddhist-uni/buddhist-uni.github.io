A detailed analysis of the question of whether things exist from a Western perspective.

The author moves through the premises, inferences, and conclusions of the conservative conception of objects and also the eliminative and permissive views, problimatizing each one.
The analysis ends with a brief discussion about which objects may exist fundamentally.
