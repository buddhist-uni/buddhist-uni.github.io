> The Tathagata's lion's roar has content, and its content varies in the different suttas that contain the simile.

Comparing the Buddha to a lion is common in the Sutta Piṭaka, though it carries different meanings. This article is a study of the simile of the Buddha as a lion and, in particular, his lion's roar. The author goes through the various uages, providing useful explanations and cross-references.
