> In the early decades of the twentieth century, as Japanese society became engulfed in war and increasing nationalism, the majority of Buddhist leaders and institutions capitulated to the status quo.
> One notable exception to this trend, however, was the *Shinko Bukkyo Seinen Domei* (Youth League for Revitalizing Buddhism), founded on 5 April 1931.

> Led by Nichiren Buddhist layman Seno'o Giro and made up of young social activists who were critical of capitalism, internationalist in outlook, and committed to a pan-sectarian and humanist form of  Buddhism that would work for social justice and world peace, the league's motto was "carry the Buddha on your backs and go out into the streets"
