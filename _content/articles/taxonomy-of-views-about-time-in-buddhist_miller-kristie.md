> We find the claim that time is not real in both Western and Eastern philosophical traditions and, more recently, in contemporary physics.
> Yet it seems unlikely that when McTaggart, Godel, Barbour, and Dzogchen practitioners say that there is no time, they are denying the existence of the same thing.
> This essay is an attempt to set out a taxonomy of different views about what it takes for there to be time and, alongside that, a taxonomy of views about whether or not there is time.
