> The post-modern epistemic absolute is based on the belief that knowledge is intrinsically tied to identity. And consequently this belief embraces positionality and standpoint theories as valid theoretical and practical foundations for personal and communal education, or cultivation. These beliefs come to percolate contemporary Buddhist discourse more and more.

In this interview, Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā discusses her paper for the 2021 TLKY International Conference. That paper focused on the dialogue between early Buddhism and postmodern discourse on ideas of self-identity, self-conceit, and the construction of first-person experience and whether liberation is truly subjective.
