> The Theragāthā of the Khuddakanikāya has only ten stanzas 
[(vv. 527–536) uttered by the Elder Kāḷudāyī](https://suttacentral.net/thag10.1/en/sujato).
However, the Madhuratthavilāsinī (Bv-a) preserves 64 stanzas ascribed to the Elder while the Visuddhajanavilāsinī (Ap-a) quotes a different series consisting of 48 stanzas ascribed to him.
