> How could suffering affect  
The man whose mind is thus cultivated  And which, like a rock,  
Stands unmoving,  
Detached from pleasant things

An example of a composite sutra from the EA, showing how this collection was made from a jumble of texts. It also contains a concrete example of the Mahayana growing out of Early Buddhism, in its use of the term "vajra"
