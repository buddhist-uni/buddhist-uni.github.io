> In Jainism there is no equivalent path to the bodhisatt(v)a path; the karma that guarantees jinahood is bound a mere two births before that attainment, and the person who attracts that karma cannot do so willfully, nor is he aware of it being bound.
> There is therefore no Jain equivalent to the ubiquitous jātaka literature.
> In this paper I will explore what the absence of a jātaka genre in Jain traditions tells us about the genre’s role in Buddhism.
