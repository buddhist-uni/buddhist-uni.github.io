> Ideally, a Buddhist temple must have certain symbols and facilities.
These  include a shrine  room  with  a Buddha  statue  and  statues  of Buddha's main  disciples, a bo tree and  a small shrine,  a pagoda with relics,  living quarters for the monks, a preaching  hall,  and  a compound  for people to gather  and  offer flowers. It is also customary  to have a small deity shrine within the temple premises.

A matter-of-fact, anthropological description of a typical Sri Lankan temple.
