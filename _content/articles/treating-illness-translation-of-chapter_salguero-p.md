> Zhiyi was notable as a systematizer and domesticator of Buddhist knowledge, and particularly for his writings on śamatha and vipaśyanā meditation.
> The excerpt translated below is a complete chapter from the shorter of his meditation treatises.
> It focuses specifically on how various strands of Indian and Chinese medical and religious knowledge could be employed to diagnose and treat illness while the practitioner remained engaged in seated meditation.

> Incorporating both foreign and domestic knowledge into the framework of śamatha and vipaśyanā , this chapter represents one of the earliest examples of systematic Indo-Sinitic medical syncretism, and one of the most important expressions of a unique medieval Chinese Buddhist perspective on healing.
