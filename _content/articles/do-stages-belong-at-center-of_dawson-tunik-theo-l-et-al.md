> We do not think that developmental stages should be the centerpiece of a
developmental theory. At the center of such a theory, we seek fundamental principles
that can explain and predict developmental phenomena, not simply describe them.
Stages are descriptions of phenomena. Even when stage definitions are highly
abstract, they must point to observables. That is their value.
