> Reverse glass paintings, a form of Chinese export art, were extensively traded in the nineteenth century.
> Several examples are on display in prominent Thai Buddhist monasteries in Bangkok.

> King Nangklao of Siam, Rama III, encouraged Sino-Siamese trade that brought Chinese objects and images to nineteenth-century Siam.
> The ideals of accretion and abundance characteristic of Thai Buddhism and the sinophilia of Rama III facilitated the construction of “Chinese-style” Thai temples.
> Glass paintings with scenes of the Pearl River Delta, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, auspicious objects, and bird-and-flower compositions were installed in temples and inspired new directions in Thai mural painting.
