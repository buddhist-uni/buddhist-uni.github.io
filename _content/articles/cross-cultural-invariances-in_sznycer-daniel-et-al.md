> Here we report data supporting the broader claim that shame is a basic part of human biology.

> We conducted an experiment among 899 participants in 15 small-scale communities scattered around the world.
> Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, shame in each community closely tracked the devaluation of local audiences (mean r = +0.84).
> The fact that the same pattern is encountered in such mutually remote communities suggests that shame's match to audience devaluation is a design feature crafted by selection and not a product of cultural contact or convergent cultural evolution.
