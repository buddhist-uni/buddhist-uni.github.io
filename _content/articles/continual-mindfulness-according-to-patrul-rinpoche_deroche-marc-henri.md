In Buddhist traditions, mindfulness is not limited to meditation; it applies to the
entire path. Moreover, mindfulness cannot be regarded as something
purely instrumental because it is part of a fundamentally reverential attitude. Thus, the various uses and misuses of the term “mindfulness” should
not lead us to dismiss the importance of its ethical and soteriological role
in Buddhism. 

In this article, Professor Deroche examines how mindfulness functions as a foundational ethical practice in Patrul Rinpoche’s Words of My Perfect Teacher. It argues that sustained mindfulness, meta-awareness, and self-examination are essential to cultivating moral agency and embodying the ethos of the Great Perfection, ultimately leading to the realization of Dzogchen’s “instantaneous awareness.”
