> In Buddhist traditions, mindfulness is not limited to meditation; it applies to the
entire path. Moreover, mindfulness cannot be regarded as something
purely instrumental...

Mindfulness functions as a foundational ethical practice in Patrul Rinpoche’s *Words of My Perfect Teacher*.
Sustained mindfulness, meta-awareness, and self-examination are essential to cultivating moral agency and embodying the *ethos* of the Great Perfection, ultimately leading to the realization of Dzogchen’s “instantaneous awareness.”
