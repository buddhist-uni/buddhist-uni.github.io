> In the early post-independence period in Burma, a large number of hierarchical, initiatory, and secretive esoteric congregations were founded by charismatic leaders in urban areas.
> These attracted many devotees, including representatives of the state.
> The relationship between the state and the esoteric congregations was tense, especially during the rule of the military governments, and the state sought to suppress the congregations in the early 1980s.

> In this article, one esoteric congregation—the ariyā-weizzā organization—is taken as an example of these congregations:
> 1. First, the article demonstrates how the members of this congregation view themselves as performing the state, and shows what kind of power they perceive themselves to exercise.
> 2. Second, in socio-political terms, the article seeks to explain why tensions emerged between the state and the esoteric congregations, and it demonstrates how these congregations have contributed to performing the state.
