> Policy-makers often mistakenly view host state security and refugee security as unrelated–or even opposing–factors.
> In reality, refugee protection and state stability are linked together; undermining one factor weakens the other.
> Policies to protect refugees, both physically and legally, reduce potential threats from the crisis and bolster state security.
> In general, risks of conflict are higher when refugees live in oppressive settings, lack legal income-generation options, and are denied education for their youth.
