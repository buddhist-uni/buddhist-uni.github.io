This is a translation of the circa 10th century Ceylon text Nāmarūpasamāso, also known as Khemappakaraṇa in Burma, where the text gained popularity. The translation follows an original Sinhala manuscript and a later Burmese manuscript. Nāmarūpasamāso is a short treatise on the mind and mental processes (cetasikas) with a final section of 28 mnemonic verses.
