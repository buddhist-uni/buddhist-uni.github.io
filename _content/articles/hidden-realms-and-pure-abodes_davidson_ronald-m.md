> Missionary monks encountered these zones of multicultural influences, either in situ or in the diasporas of the
great cities of North India or China, many of them became enamored of the

In this article, Davidson posits Central Asia's centrality, via the Silk Road, in not only disseminating Buddhism but shaping it as well. He highlights the numerous texts, such as sutras, vinayas, and mythologies, that have come from this area and influenced Buddhism in India, China, and Tibet. He ends the article with consideration for the adventurous and mysterious image that Central Asia held for these cultures.
