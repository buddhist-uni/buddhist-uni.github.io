> … hypnotic response and meditation involve opposite processes

Meditation plunges us into the depths of the (normally) subconscious processes of intentions forming and contending in the mind. As we become more familiar with these processes, we can more quickly and accurately identify when, how and why the mind moves: pushing back the curtain of ignorance on the workings of our subconscious mind and reducing our tendency to be hypnotized and controlled.

And for a more recent study confirming the result, see “[The association between mindfulness and hypnotizability](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6263151/pdf/nihms-1502178.pdf)” American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. 2018 Jul; 61(1):4–17. doi: [10.1080/00029157.2017.1419458](https://doi.org/10.1080/00029157.2017.1419458)
