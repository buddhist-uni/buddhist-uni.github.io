> Widely read as he was in Western philosophy, one of Nishida’s main concerns was to find possible points of contact between his own heritage and the philosophical background of the modern civilization that was taking shape in Japan during his lifetime.

A comparative analysis of Kitarō Nishida and Dōgen Kigen's thoughts on space and time and how these concepts are presented throughout their life's work. The article largely focuses on the thought of Nishida, a 20th-century Japanese philosopher. While it is known that Nishida was greatly influenced by Western philosophy, the author brings Nishida into dialogue with Dōgen, particularly his [Being-Time](/content/essays/time-being_dogen), in an attempt to show that Nishida was firmly rooted in Asian thought.
