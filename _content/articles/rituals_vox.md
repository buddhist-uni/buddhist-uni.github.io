> Experiment and have fun with it.

> Rituals can be an artistic process, a meditation, a communal celebration, or a simple act of
observation, according to Kate Southworth, a London-based artist whose works are rooted in ritual.
“Rituals often have an intention,” Southworth said. “I think the framing of that intention to be as
important as its enactment.”

The article explains that rituals—unlike productivity-driven routines—help people instill a sense of calm and sustain mindfulness by imbuing ordinary actions with intention and meaning. In this way, rituals can stabilize life and foster connection in an otherwise distracted, fast-paced world.
