> Men’s higher testosterone is typically seen as an innate “sex” difference.
> However, our experiment demonstrates that gender-related social factors also matter, even for biological measures.
> Gender socialization may affect testosterone by encouraging men but not women toward behaviors that increase testosterone.
> This shows that research on human sex biology needs to account for gender socialization and that nurture, as well as nature, is salient to hormone physiology.
> Our paper provides a demonstration of a novel gender→testosterone pathway, opening up new avenues for studying gender biology.
