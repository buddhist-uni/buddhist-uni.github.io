> I feel it’s really important to reach the heart, because people have got to change from within. They’ve got to change because they want to change. And if you batter at them and try to blind them with science, they don’t want to listen to you. But if you can quietly tell a story, then you may reach the heart. And that’s when people change.

An interview with Jane Goodall, primatologist and anthropologist, on her research and what her findings can teach about human nature and the current climate crisis. Goodall highlights how humans are similar to chimps, being capable of both altruism and aggressive behavior. The interview also covers climate change, meat consumption, and how stories can help change people's views.
