> Here I would like to give one example which may offer sufficient evidence to
support the claim that the original texts of these Chinese Saṃyuktāgamas are indeed
to be ascribed to the Sarvāstivādins.

>  The reaction of Anāthapiṇḍada in both the ChSA1 and the ClaSA2
is to have goose flesh upon hearing the sound or the name `Buddha' for 
the first time.
The same recension as these two sutras is found only in Sarvāstivādin
texts, namely the Shisong-lu 十誦律 and the MSV.
