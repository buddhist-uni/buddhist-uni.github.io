Viewing the relationship between the monks and laity in Thailand as merely "ritualized intergenerational reciprocity" is untenable as it doesn't account for the diversity of ages among both the monkhood and donors let alone the beliefs animating their practices.
This article thus highlights a danger in the overly-materialistic "Structuralist" approach to cultural anthropology.
