> Such absence can be specific, in the sense of the absence of a particular mental condition.
> It can also take on a general sense, in that certain meditation practices that involve mindfulness can take as their object the notion that there is nothing at all.
> Besides being the standard approach for cultivating one of the immaterial spheres, a pre-Buddhist form of practice, the same notion that there is nothing can also be related to insight.
