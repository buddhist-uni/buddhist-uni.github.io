> Continuously enfolding the lives,
activities, values and times of all its previous inhabitants, the landscape is
simultaneously unfolding to its current inhabitant or observer as a
corpus of heterogeneous narratives – myths, legends, historical accounts or individual
life-histories attached to it. [...]
‘Landscape is time materializing.’
