> I mean, thank God that the people that run this world are not smart enough to keep running it forever.

A short news article about [Arlo Guthrie's song "Alice's Resturant."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant)

It tells the story of how Guthrie was arrested and fined for a simple act of kindness and how this record kept him from being drafted into the Vietnam War. Since being released in 1967, the song has become a Thanksgiving Day staple across the United States.
