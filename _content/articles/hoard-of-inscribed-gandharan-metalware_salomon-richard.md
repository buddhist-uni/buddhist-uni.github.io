> The article describes a set of seven silver objects – three goblets, two ladles,
a bowl and a cup – bearing short dedicatory inscriptions in Kharoṣṭhī script datable to around the first century CE. The inscriptions record in the usual Gandharan
fashion the donation of the utensils by a group of nuns and lay-persons, perhaps 
constituting a family, to a Sarvāstivādin monastery called Utarode(v)a 
located at an otherwise unknown place, 'Koṇaśili.'
