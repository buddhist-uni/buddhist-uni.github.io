> Our results provide firm evidence that implicit and explicit memory have distinct functional neuroanatomies, and that strategic control of retrieval engages brain structures distinct from those involved in both implicit and explicit memory.
> They have critical implications for theories of memory and consciousness, which often equate consciousness with control.
