> Hirakawa criticizes the use of religion as a business tool for placating the economic  anxieties  of  workers,  and  for  creating  harmonious  relationships  among  them. This is a complete misuse of religion, and in fact is administered to workers as an opiate.

This paper explores the theme of Buddhism's death and rebirth in modern Japan, as presented in various works by Buddhist priests, scholars, and writers aimed at the general public. It discusses two main approaches to reviving Buddhism: one through socially engaged activities detached from traditional teachings, and the other through the revival of traditional doctrines, while highlighting the absence of new interpretations that could challenge old understandings in a meaningful way.
