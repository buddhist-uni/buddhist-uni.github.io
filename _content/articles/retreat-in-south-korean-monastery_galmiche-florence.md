> Even the remote mountain monasteries have broadened their access to lay visitors.
> Nowadays monastic and lay Buddhists have more occasions to meet than before and the current intensification of their relationships brings important redefinitions of their respective identities.

> I focus on a one-week retreat for laity in a Buddhist monastery dedicated to meditation.
> This case study examines the ambiguous goal of this retreat programme that combined two aims: initiating lay practitioners to the monastic lifestyle and the practice of *kanhwa son* meditation; and establishing a group of lay supporters affiliated to the temple.
> This temporary monastic experience was directed towards an intense socialisation of the participants to the norms and values of an ascetic lifestyle, blurring some aspects of the border between lay and monastic practices of Buddhism.
> However, this paper suggests that this transitory rapprochement contributed to both challenge and strengthen the distinction between the renouncers (*ch'ulga*) and the householders (*chaega*).
