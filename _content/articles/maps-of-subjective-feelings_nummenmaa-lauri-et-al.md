> Subjective feelings are a central feature of human life, yet their relative organization has remained elusive.
> We mapped the “human feeling space” for 100 core feelings ranging from cognitive and affective processes to somatic sensations; in the analysis, we combined basic dimension rating, similarity mapping, bodily sensation mapping, and neuroimaging meta-analysis.


> Feelings formed five groups: positive emotions, negative emotions, cognitive processes, somatic states, and homeostatic states.
> Feeling space was best explained by emotionality, mental experience, and bodily sensation topographies.
