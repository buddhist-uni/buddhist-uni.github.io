> To ask whether Buddhism accepts the instrumental use of animals, whether human or otherwise is, again, to look for Western concepts and ideas, and perhaps even specifically modern ones, in an ancient, Asian tradition. I do not want to take sides on the issue at all; my concern, rather, is to identify any hidden assumptions that may prevent us from judging the tradition on its own terms.

This article defends Buddhism against Paul Waldau’s accusation of speciesism, arguing that Waldau incorrectly attributes certain Western moral concepts to Buddhism. It suggests that these concepts, such as intrinsic moral value based on specific traits and ethical treatment of humans, may not be inherent to Buddhism. Additionally, it highlights that Pāli texts do not seem to grant intrinsic value to any life form, suggesting that Buddhists should seek explanations within their own tradition for ecological concerns.
