> On the basis of a large set of diverse stylistic markers, this paper argues that the Ekottarikāgama T 125 was translated by Zhu Fonian, and not by Saṃghadeva. The paper also considers implications of its findings for the broader corpus of texts ascribed to Zhu Fonian, and for methods in assessing ascriptions of Chinese Buddhist texts on the basis of internal evidence.
