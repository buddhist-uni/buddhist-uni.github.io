> During the early months of the pandemic, Google searches for prayer relative to all Google searches rose by 30%, reaching the highest level ever recorded.
> A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that by April 1, 2020, more than half of the world population had prayed to end the coronavirus.

> Prayer searches rose more among the more religious, rose on all continents, at all levels of income, inequality, and insecurity, and for all types of religion except Buddhism.
