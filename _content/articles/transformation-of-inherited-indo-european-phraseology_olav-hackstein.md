>The same Indo-European metaphor for
abusing paternal property is traceable in the Middle Iranian and Indic
tradition, ranging from Vedic to (Buddhist) Sanskrit dāyāda-.

This article focuses on the philology of a Sanskrit term and its relation to the Buddhist story of Ajātaśatru and how it is understood. The study focuses on the translation of the term dāyāda and how Indo-European metaphors, mainly Homeric, informed the translation and understanding of the term into other languages, particularly West Tocharian.
