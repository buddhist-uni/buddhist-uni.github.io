>The same Indo-European metaphor for
abusing paternal property is traceable in the Middle Iranian and Indic
tradition, ranging from Vedic to (Buddhist) Sanskrit dāyāda-.

This article focuses on the philology of the Sanskrit term *dāyāda* and its relation to the Buddhist story of Ajātaśatru. Dāyāda is a Sanskrit and Pāli term usually translated as 'heir'. For example, "*kamma-dāyādo*" is to be the heir of one's actions.

This article argues there is a second interpretation of the term as eating (*√ad*) what is given (*dāya*), i.e., one eats the fruits of one's karma. The study here focuses on how Indo-European metaphors inform this translation and understanding of the term, using various related languages, especially West Tocharian.
