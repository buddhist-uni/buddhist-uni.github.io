> Our findings could be laid out along a developmental continuum: portrayals were seen to range from unreflective voicing of a reified self, to more developed self-narratives in which mindful awareness (a meta-position) was portrayed in dialogue: bringing an inquisitive, present-focused, and compassionate awareness to habitual reactions.
> The telos of development, as seen from both [Dialogical Self Theory and Buddhist] perspectives, entails de-positioning: describing simple awareness of being.
> Our analyses display how the  voice de-reifies self, and how that voice may be taken up by practitioners, to varying extents.
