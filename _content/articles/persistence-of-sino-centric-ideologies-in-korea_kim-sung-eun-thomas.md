> The notion of chunghwa 中華, an ideology that points to China as the place of cultural origin, was commonly adopted by both the Confucian scholar-officials and Buddhist monks during Chosŏn Korea (1392–1910).

> Paekgok’s composition [the *Taegak Tŭnggye jip* 대각등계집] is a further example of how no division between Korean and Chinese history was perceived.

> It was after the Sino-Japanese war of 1894 that such conceptions of China were shattered, leading the Koreans to be more open to western influences.
