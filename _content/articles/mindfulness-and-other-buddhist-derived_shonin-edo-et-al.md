> The eight eligible studies comprised two mindfulness studies, four vipassana meditation studies, and two studies utilizing other Buddhist-Derived Interventions.
> Intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements across five key criminogenic variables: (i) negative affect, (ii) substance use (and related attitudes), (iii) anger and hostility, (iv) relaxation capacity, and (v) self-esteem and optimism.
> There were, however, a number of major quality issues.
> It is concluded that BDIs may be feasible and effective rehabilitative interventions for incarcerated populations.
> However, if the potential suitability and efficacy of BDIs for prisoner populations is to be evaluated in earnest, it is essential that methodological rigor is substantially improved.
