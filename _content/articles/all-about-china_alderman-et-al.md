> We examine the extent to which domestic political developments can be understood through a US–China great power lens. Are politically progressive Thais more likely to be pro-US, and more politically conservative Thais likely to favor China? While we find some relationship between liberal domestic political leanings and sympathy for the United States, we also show that conservative domestic political leanings do not automatically translate into support for China.

The mp3 linked above is to [a *Talking Thai Politics* conversation](https://newbooksnetwork.com/talking-thai-politics-petra-alderman-why-thai-politics-isnt-all-about-china-in-conversation-with-duncan-mccargo) between the article's first two co-authors discussing their paper and its implications.
