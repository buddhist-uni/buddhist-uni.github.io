> In Ulan-Ude, the multi-ethnic, multi-religious capital of Buryatia, most laypeople make use of “Buddhist counseling” (Rus.
>  priyom u lamy ), or various ritual, medical and other services that ameliorate illness and misfortune.
> Laypeople consult lamas about a range of issues from economic to familial matters, from imp attacks to joblessness.
> Such Buddhist counseling is one of the most common kind of interactions with Buddhist institutions and practices in Buryatia.
> At the same time, it is a deeply contested practice, as local critiques refer to the rise of “consumerist”, “commercialized”, “utilitarian” or “bad” Buddhism.
