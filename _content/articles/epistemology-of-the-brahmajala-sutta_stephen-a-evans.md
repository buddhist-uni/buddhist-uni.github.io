A major focus of the Brahmajala Sutta is the discussion of 62 false views (ditthi). This article attempts to uncover an epistemological standpoint from which these views are seen to be false. This standpoint, which the author calls a mode of being, is aware of itself as such (i.e., a standpoint), and it is this awareness itself that leads to transformation.
