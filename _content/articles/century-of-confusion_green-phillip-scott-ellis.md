This article reexamines the iconography of three tenth-century towers located in eastern Cambodia at Phnom Trap, arguing that the figures depicted on the inner brick reliefs are Buddhist, not Vaiṣṇava or Śaiva as previously described in early surveys. By establishing the Buddhist orientation of this site, the author attempts to demonstrate that forms of Buddhism in tenth-century Cambodia were more widespread than previously acknowledged.
