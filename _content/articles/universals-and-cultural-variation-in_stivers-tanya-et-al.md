> Informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human social life.
> A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is to speak and when.


> Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from traditional indigenous communities to major world languages, we show that all of the languages tested provide clear evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a minimization of silence between conversational turns.
