> This model proposes four intervals in a cognitive cycle: mind wandering, awareness of mind wandering, shifting of attention, and sustained attention.
> People who train in this style of meditation cultivate their abilities to monitor cognitive processes related to attention and distraction

> Analyses revealed activity in brain regions associated with the default mode during mind wandering, and in salience network regions during awareness of mind wandering.
> Elements of the executive network were active during shifting and sustained attention.
> Furthermore, activations during these cognitive phases were modulated by lifetime meditation experience.
