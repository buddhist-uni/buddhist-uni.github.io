> This ceremony centres on the recitation—usually by Buddhist monks—of extracts fron the Pali Canon, collected in a text called the *Gatubhāṇavārapāli*, *Paritta* or in Siahala *Piruvānāpotvahanse*. Its objective is to ward off danger, ensure protection and bless the sponsors. 
It is prevalent in other Theravada Buddhist countries such as Burma and Thailand as well, but this work is confined to a study of the tradition preserved in Sri Lanka.
