> When the next generation starts its career, the stocks have further declined, but it is
the stocks at that time that serve as a new
baseline. The result obviously is a gradual
shift of the baseline, a gradual accommodation of the creeping disappearance of

resulting from overfishing, or for identifying targets for rehabilitation
