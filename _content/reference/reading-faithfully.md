If you are looking to dive into the suttas, there are many good pointers and many valuable resources to be found on this blog.

A good place to start, is their ["How To Guide"](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/how-to-sutta-practice-basics/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.4"} and I personally love the posts on [keeping a personal "medicine cabinet"](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/personal-sutta-anthology/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.5"} and on [using sutta checklists](https://www.readingfaithfully.org/sutta-checklists-for-tracking-reading-suttas/){:target="_blank" ga-event-value="0.2"}.
