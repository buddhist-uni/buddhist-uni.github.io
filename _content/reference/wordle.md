Wordle is an online, word-puzzle game made by Josh Wardle in 2021 [for his partner](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) based on the two-player guessing game "[Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto){:target="_blank"}" invented by Morton M. Rosenfeld in 1955.
