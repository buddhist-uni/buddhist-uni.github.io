Wordle is an online, word puzzle game made by Josh Wardle in 2021 [for his partner](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) based on the two-player guessing-game "[Jotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto){:target="_blank"}" invented by Morton M. Rosenfeld in 1955.

You can find [an open-source Pāli spin on the game](https://labs.buddhistuniversity.net/wordle-pali) on [our "Labs" site](https://labs.buddhistuniversity.net/wordle-pali)

และเวอเดิ้ล[ฉบับภาษาไทยของเราอยู่ที่นี่](https://bit.ly/wordlethai)
