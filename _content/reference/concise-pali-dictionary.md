A landmark glossary still in print today, the short, friendly entries of the CPED—and its unique [English-Pāli sister dictionary](https://www.budsas.org/ebud/dict-ep/index.htm)—have made it a favorite of students and [hackers](https://github.com/simsapa/simsapa-dictionary/blob/master/README.md) alike for decades.

It has been incorporated into apps for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pali-english-dictionary/id1472853947) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tummosoft.paliplus) as well as into web apps such as [the Digital Pāli Reader](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html?feature=dictionary&type=CPED&query=metta&opts=xv,xd,xm,xs,xa,xk,xy,mm,ma,mt,sw,hd){:target="_blank"} and [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net/define/mettacitta){:target="_blank"}, whose heavily modified "new" version can be downloaded [as a raw json file here](https://github.com/suttacentral/sc-data/blob/master/dictionaries/simple/en/pli2en_ncped.json?raw=true).
The dictionary has even been translated into [Chinese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wPIAUDM_HOOP2UgrSZKuR-JI9R_TTFyN/view?usp=drivesdk).
