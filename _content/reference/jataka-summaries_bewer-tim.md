> I did not write these stories for any religious or scholarly reasons. I’m not a Buddhist, an academic, or a storyteller; and I wasn’t seeking moral guidance. I just love Thai Buddhist art... My only goal for these stories was to make them as easy and enjoyable to read as possible.

Short, entertaining summaries of all [the traditional Jātaka tales](/content/canon/ja+cmy_anandajoti).
