Sometimes people will reference suttas in the Majjhima Nikāya by their Pāli name. This handy chart helps you to map that Pāli name (e.g. "The Madhurā Sutta") to its MN number (e.g. 84).

For an index of Pāli names across the entire Sutta Piṭaka, see [the sutta name index](/content/reference/pali-name-index).
