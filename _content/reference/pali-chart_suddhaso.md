An extremely concise reference sheet for reading early P훮li.

Containing the noun declensions, verb tenses, unusual pronouns, indeclinables, participles, and even the middle voice, this chart is a handy reference to have on hand while reading P훮li suttas or Vinaya.
It's intended merely as an aid to jog your memory as it assumes prior knowledge of P훮li grammar.
