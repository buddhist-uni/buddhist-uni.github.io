Still the most comprehensive dictionary of Pāḷi a hundred years later, the PED has today been thoroughly digitized and made available online.

The PED is slowly being supplanted by a new *Dictionary of Pāli*, whose fourth and final volume [is currently under preparation by Martin Straube at the PTS](http://palitext.com/subpages/proj.htm){:target="_blank"}.
