This is a transcription of a series of lectures given by an unknown author, found in the library of the Chanmay Meditation Centre in Burma. The transcipts cover the first chapter of the Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha. The remaining chapters, if they exist, have not been located. The Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha is a Pāli compendium of the Abhidhamma of the Theravāda tradition and was written between the 8th and 12th centuries by the Sri Lankan monk Ācariya Anuruddha.Description
