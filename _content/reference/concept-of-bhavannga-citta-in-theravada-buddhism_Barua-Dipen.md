This PhD dissertation examines the concept of bhavaṅga in Theravāda Buddhism, exploring three interpretations. The first interpretation, from the Netti, links bhavaṅga to the twelve factors of dependent co-arising and the cycle of saṃsāric life. The second interpretation considers bhavaṅga-consciousness in contexts like rebirth, sleep, and meditation. The third interpretation, from commentaries, views bhavaṅga-consciousness as pure and luminous, comparable to the Upanishadic “self,” but ultimately highlights the impermanence and conditioned nature of all consciousness in Buddhism.
