A brief selection ofPa-Auk Tawya Sayadaw that explaining that the Buddhaâ€™s teachings are deep and difficult to grasp, with even the Buddha himself describing them as subtle, peaceful, and beyond simple reasoning. It also highlights how the Buddha initially hesitated to teach due to people's attachment to sensual pleasures but chose to teach to benefit those few who could understand, stressing the importance of humility in sharing the Dhamma and accurately transmitting the Buddha's teachings.
