The Taishō is the modern edition of the Mahayana Canon. You may have seen Taishō numbers before to refer to Mahayana Sutras (e.g. T100). This lengthy PDF gives an overview of the numbering scheme and points out  specific numbers for many popular Mahayana texts. 

Useful both as a reference and just to get a sense of how large the Canon is.
