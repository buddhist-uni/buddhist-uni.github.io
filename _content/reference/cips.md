An exhaustive index of the terms, topics, proper names, and similes found in the Pāḷi Sutta Piṭaka.

Note that as of July, 2024 the index is still a work in progress, with the SN partially tagged and the DN not yet begun.
As this is a work-in-progress, [your feedback is welcome](https://github.com/thesunshade/sutta-index/blob/main/src/documentation/helpfulFeedback.md#offering-feedback).
