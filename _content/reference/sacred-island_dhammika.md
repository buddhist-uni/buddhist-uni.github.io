> The Saddhammopáyana puts it like this: “This Buddha land is illuminated by the luster of the sun of supreme wisdom and
cooled by the moon of compassion. It is everywhere enclosed by
the lofty peaks of the Buddha’s Dhamma and with hills of the gold
and jewels of true understanding. The lions of self-confidence
living comfortably and fearlessly in the forest of the Sangha
decorate it.

This travel guide is designed for Buddhists or anyone interested in Buddhism visiting Sri Lanka. It offers insights into archaeological facts, art history, and legends, while also providing practical advice, maps, and illustrations.
