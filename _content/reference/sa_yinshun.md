A spreadsheet showing the reconstructed "proper" order of the SA discourses, along with a table of their known parallels in the Pāli and Āgama Canons.

The table is based on [Yinshun's original work on the SA in Chinese](https://cbetaonline.cn/zh/Y0030_001){:target="_blank"}.
You can find [a discussion about the table on SuttaCentral here](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/yinshuns-reconstruction-of-the-chinese-sa-yukta-agama-taisho-99/14117){:target="_blank"}.
