> … basic realities about the world in which we live

The Trump administration took down *The World Factbook* in February 2026 as [a part of](https://verfassungsblog.de/education-democracy-america/) their [war on facts](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/popular-sovereignty-doesnt-exist-without-public-knowledge/).

Many of the site's pages are still accessible [on Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20260130084537/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) as they were in January 2026 and [the entire 2020 version is available on GitHub](https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020/).
