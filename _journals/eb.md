Founded by D. T. Suzuki in 1921, *The Eastern Buddhist* is a Japanese publication in English dedicated to the critical exploration of Buddhism as a living religion.

It was only published sporadically after the death of Beatrice Suzuki (D. T.'s wife and chief editor) in 1939, but it picked back up again as a "New Series" in 1965.

The journal marked its centennial by relaunching as a "Third Series" in 2021.
