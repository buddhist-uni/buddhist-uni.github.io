Founded by D. T. Suzuki in 1921, *The Eastern Buddhist* is a Japanese publication dedicated to the critical exploration of Buddhism as a living religion.

Its publication was interrupted by World War II in 1958, but picked back up as a "New Series" in 1965.

The journal then marked its centennial by [restarting as a "Third Series" in 2021 after getting a few years behind their publishing schedule](https://otani.repo.nii.ac.jp/record/10429/files/EB3rd_1-1_03_pp1-6.pdf).
