A series of small booklets, measuring 4.3" x 5.4" and ranging between 16 and 40 pages, that were sent periodically to members of the Buddhist Publication Society between 1960 and the early 2000s.

Less academic than the [_Wheel Series_](/series/wheel), the _Bodhi Leaves_ essays offered more personal reflections on Dhamma practice, largely from the Sri Lankan, TheravƒÅda perspective.
