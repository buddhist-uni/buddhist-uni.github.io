After the end of the *University of Ceylon Review*, the *Ceylon Journal of the Humanities* was founded to carry on their work. After a couple years of publishing under that name, it assumed the current name in 1972.

The journal's back catalog can be read [on DSpace, here](https://ir.lib.pdn.ac.lk/collections/965fe1d0-9992-48d9-a59e-c681c0444b2d).
