Not to be confused with their Chinese-language journal ([Chung-Hwa Buddhist Studies](http://www.chibs.edu.tw/ch_html/index_ch00_0703.html){:target="_blank"}), The Journal of Chinese Buddhist Studies was, until 2014, known as "The Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal." Before 1987, it was known as the "Hwakang Buddhist Journal."
