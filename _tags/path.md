  The fifth painting from Yuán Jǐ (原濟)'s 1695 album of calligraphy titled "Coming Home" (歸棹) currently housed at
  <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/49173">The Met</a>
  uses a trip down a foggy river as an allegory for the spiritual journey.
  The Buddha often compared his teachings to a raft which ferries beings across a dangerous river to a far shore of safety, an allegorical tradition Shí Tāo (石濤 as he's more usually known) is certainly drawing on here when he writes opposite this painting,
  ⟨ 放眼江天外，賒心寸草亭。⟩
  "Looking beyond the river and sky, lose [your] heart in a grass hut."
