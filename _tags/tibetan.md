  A group of red-robed monks share sodas and snacks at a monastery event in Kham in 2009.
  One monk is offering a drink to the lama, seated high and center,
  while the rest of the monks are lined up behind low tables on his left and right.
  The painted banners hanging overhead represent their main meditation practice:
  tantric visualization.
  These practices are considered dangerous to do without the guidance of a wise master.
