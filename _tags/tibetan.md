  A group of red-robed monks share sodas and snacks at a monastery event in Kham in 2009.
  One monk is offering a drink to the lama, seated high and center,
  while the rest of the monks are lined up behind low tables on his left and right.
  The painted banners hanging overhead represent their main meditation practice:
  tantric visualization.
  These practices are considered dangerous to do without the guidance of a wise master.

Inner Asia inherited Vajrayāna Buddhism from medieval India,
incorporating elements of its indigenous religions as Buddhism spread
across the Tibetan Plateau to Mongolia and Bhutan.
Characterized by strong institutions and elaborate rituals,
Tibetan Buddhism preserved much of the scholastic culture of late-Indian Buddhism
along with its esoteric and devotional practices which often center the figure of the guru, or *lama*.
While Tibetan Buddhists recognize the validity of other forms of Buddhist practice,
they usually feel that the Tantric practices are especially powerful and efficacious if practiced correctly.
