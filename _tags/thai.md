  Lay people relax in front of the Phra Phuttha Sihing at the "Front Palace" of what is now the Bangkok National Museum.
  The Buddha image is considered second in importance only to the Emerald Buddha housed at the Grand Palace.
  Buddhism in modern Thailand is strongly entangled with the Thai state.

The forms of Buddhism practiced in Thailand.

Thai Buddhism is predominantly TheravƒÅdan, but shows a variety of influences,
including indigenous Shamanism,
Chinese and Indic gods brought in by traders, and
modernist reforms, which have combined
to give Thai Buddhism its distinct flavor.
