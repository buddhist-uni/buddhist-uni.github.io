Receiving the full range of the Chinese schools since the fourth century,
Korean Buddhists created their own synthesis particularly integrating
Chan practice (which they call "Seon 선") with doctrinal study.
After centuries of persecution under the Confucian Joseon Dynasty (1392--1910),
Buddhism today is a weakened but enduring force in Korean culture and thought.
