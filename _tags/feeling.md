  A Bengali man laughs with his sister as she smears turmeric paste on his arms
  in preparation for his wedding in 2012.
  Behind them a small band seated on plastic chairs plays music.
  Touch, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and ideas such as these trigger emotional reactions in humans.
  In this case, presumably, joy.

Feelings are the subjective processes by which the mind and body interact.

**Sensations** flow from the senses to the mind (mostly through the nervous system), and the mind's subconscious evaluations form **emotions** which alter the body's physiology (largely through the release of hormones).
Together, we call these "feelings."

For the mind's more consciously agentic processes, see [The Intellect](/tags/intellect).
