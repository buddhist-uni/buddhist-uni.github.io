Feelings are the subjective processes by which the mind and body interact.

**Sensations** flow from the senses to the mind (mostly through the nervous system), and the mind's subconscious evaluations form **emotions** which alter the body's physiology (largely through the release of hormones).
Together, we call these "feelings."

For the mind's more consciously agentic processes, see [The Intellect](/tags/intellect).
