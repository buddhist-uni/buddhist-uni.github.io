The *Sutta Piṭaka* is the second part of the *Pāli Canon*, containing the core *dhamma* teachings. It is the {% include tag-link.html text="Theravada School's" tag="theravada" %} parallel to the {% include tag-link.html text="Āgama" tag="agama" %} collection preserved in China, and contains the most accurate and complete record of the historical Buddha's teachings extant today.

It is divided into four main *Nikayas* — the *Dīgha* (long), *Majjhima* (middle-length), *Saṁyutta* (connected), and *Aṅguttara* (numbered) — along with a fifth *nikaya* (the *Khuddaka*) which contains miscellaneous poetry and rebirth stories.
