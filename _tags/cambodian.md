Buddhism in Cambodia.

The Angkorian Empire was a center of Hindu/Mahayana Buddhism in the Middle Ages,
but during the early modern period, it largely came under Siamese influence,
shifting Cambodian Buddhism towards Thai-style Theravāda, which it still resembles today.

During the Khmer Rouge (1975–1979), Buddhism in Cambodia was almost entirely destroyed,
but today it is slowly growing back thanks to its deep roots and distant seeds.
