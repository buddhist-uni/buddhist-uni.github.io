The "Large Basket" is the first and shortest *nikāya* of the *Sutta Piṭaka*, containing the 34 longest teachings and myths of the early sangha. The collection focuses largely on contrasting Buddhism with Brahmanism and is roughly parallel to the {% include tag-link.html text="Dīrgha Āgama" tag="da" %} preserved in China.
