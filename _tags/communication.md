  A diverse group of stakeholders met in 2018 around a simple, lace-covered table in Nueva Loja
  to discuss the needs of Sucumb√≠os' children with representatives of
  <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amparo_Pe%C3%B1aherrera_at_a_meeting_in_Ecuador_in_2018.jpg">UNICEF Ecuador</a>.
  Most of the table is taken up by a large outline of the province, notes, and various writing implements.
  Women around the table indicate that they are thoughtfully listening to the woman closest to the camera
  by making eye contact with her and by placing their left hand near their lips.
  Humans use a large variety of "media" (from maps to body language) to share their knowledge, thoughts, and feelings with each other
  and to cooperate towards their shared goals.
