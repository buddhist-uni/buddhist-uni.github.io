A poetry collection containing 74 short texts in verse or mixed prose arranged in five chapters,
the Suttanipāta contains some of the most popular texts in all of Buddhism, such as the Ratana, Maṅgala, and Mettā Suttas,
as well as texts such as the “Rhinoceros Horn Sutta” and the “Way to the Beyond” which are regarded as among the earliest (and most ascetic) of the scriptures.
