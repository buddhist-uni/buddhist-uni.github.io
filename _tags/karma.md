Kamma literally means "action" but in Indian philosophy it specifically refers to theories of the consequences of our actions.

The Buddha taught that it is the moral valence of our actions and the motivations behind them—whether wholesome or unwholesome—which determines whether an action will yield positive or negative consequences for us and others in the future.
