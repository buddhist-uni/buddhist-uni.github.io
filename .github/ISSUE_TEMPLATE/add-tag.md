This is a task to publish the [{{ name }}]({{ drivelink }}) folder on Google Drive as [a new bibliography/tag](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/wiki/Adding-new-tags) on the site.

This includes adding all the `course: {{ tag }}` content.
 For more information on how to add content from Drive to the website, see [the content data entry guide](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/wiki/Adding-items-to-the-library).

Steps needed to accomplish this:
  - [x] Add the tag as a draft to [_tags/](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/main/_tags)
    - Done! See **the draft tag [here](https://buddhistuniversity.net/tags/{{ tag }})**
  - [x] Add suttas from the folder to the site
  - [x] Add OpenAlex academic articles in the folder to the site
  - [ ] Add all other content from the public drive folder
  - [ ] Add any copyrighted content (e.g. YouTube links, books, or podcasts) not shared directly in the public folder
  - [ ] Add a draft set of images
  - [ ] Add a description
  - [ ] Add an image caption
  - [ ] Audit tag content for:
    - [ ] Meeting the diversity quotas
    - [ ] Weeding content that shouldn't be included
    - [ ] Harmony of description, images, and content
  - [ ] Productionize images
  - [ ] Publish the tag
  - [ ] Announce the tag on the blog/newsletter
