## The Code

OBU is a static HTML website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Running the site locally

To run the site locally:

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io.git
cd buddhist-uni.github.io
npm ci
bash scripts/install-deps.bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Keep in mind that the site build can take up to 40 mins depending on your machine.
To speed that up, you have two options:

1. You can add the `--config _config.yml,_quick_build.yml` build flag for a faster, but partial build of the site.
2. Or you can serve the production build locally like so:

~~~bash
rm -rf _site
git branch -D prod
git pull
git checkout prod
cp -r . _site
git checkout master
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --skip-initial-build
~~~

For more information on the build options, see [the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

### The Source Code

For this section of the guide, we'll walk through OBU's [source tree](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master).

You can think of each of the `_folders` in the source code as representing individual object types.
Each folder is a different "table" in a hardcoded "database":

- [_authors](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_authors) - Each author with their own page.
- [_content](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_content) - All of the individual works in the library, divided by `category` based on the type. Each content item has a number of [metadata fields](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) listing its bibliographic information (e.g. `pages`) in Bibtex format, or linking the entry out to its file (e.g. `external_url`) or linking it to its internal groups (e.g. `authors`). Conventionally, I put raw strings in `"Quotes"` and I represent links to other objects as `unquoted-slugs`. The templates then use these slugs to fetch the related objects at page render time.
- [_categories](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_categories) - This folder houses the `index.html` pages for the `/content/*` folders and contains a little metadata about the categories, such as their plain English titles.
- [_courses](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_courses) - The University's courses.
- [_data](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_data) - Site configuration [variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).
- [_drafts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_drafts) - Unpublished courses or blog posts.
- [_includes](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_includes) - A Jekyll folder which houses the site's [reusable UI components](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/).
- [_journals](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_journals) - Periodicals which get their own page.
- [_layouts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_layouts) houses the [html page templates](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/).
- [_plugins](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_plugins) is not a collection but rather contains native Ruby extensions for quickly running complex algorithms or for dynamically generating content. Currently my only custom plugin is the [similar content engine](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/blob/master/_plugins/similar_content.rb) which you can [read about here](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/replacing-a-slow-include-with-a-custom-ruby-tag/6064?u=khbh)
- [_posts](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_posts) are the [blog posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) which make up the newsletter.
- [_publishers](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_publishers) are the publishers which I have granted their own hub.
- [_sass](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_sass) contains [the site's css](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
- [_series](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_series) - Are collections of `_content` items that were published as part of a `number`ed `series` (specified by fields on the content item)
- [_tags](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_tags) - The bibliographic topics, arranged in a directed, ontological graph via the `parents` field.
- [_tests](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/_tests) - A couple of pages with [Integration Tests](https://buddhistuniversity.net/tests/content) I have used during development in the past, and decided to keep around in case the code is useful in the future.

Lastly,
- [.github/workflows](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/master/.github/workflows) contains my [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) [Workflow files](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) which build the site and check for certain errors.

For questions about the source code, feel free to [email me](mailto:khemarato.bhikkhu@gmail.com) or post an issue or comment on GitHub.

## Reuse

The beauty of Jekyll is that it outputs plain HTML, which you can find in [the repo's "prod" branch](https://github.com/buddhist-uni/buddhist-uni.github.io/tree/prod). This raw html can be reworked in a variety of ways or you can fork the repo to use the source code.
[The entire database can also be found in Bibtex format here](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content.bib), in case that's helpful, for example for importing into an academic reference manager.

**Feel free to reuse this website in any (ethical) way you like** consistent with [the attached MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).
